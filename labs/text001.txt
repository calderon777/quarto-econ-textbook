How to Submit Your Assessment

The assessment must be submitted by 12:00 noon (GMT/BST) on XXXXX. No paper copies are required. You can access the submission link through the module web.

* Your coursework will be given a zero mark if you do not submit a copy through Turnitin. Please take care to ensure that you have fully submitted your work. 
* Please ensure that you have submitted your work using the correct file format, unreadable files will receive a mark of zero. The Faculty accepts Microsoft Office and PDF documents, unless otherwise advised by the module leader.
* All work submitted after the submission deadline without a valid and approved reason will be subject to the University regulations on late submissions.
o If an assessment is submitted up to 24 hours late the mark for the work will be capped at the pass mark of 40 per cent for undergraduate modules or 50 per cent for postgraduate modules
o If an assessment is submitted beyond 24 hours late the work will receive a mark of zero per cent
o The above applies to a student’s first attempt at the assessment. If work submitted as a reassessment of a previously failed assessment task is submitted later than the deadline the work will immediately be given a mark of zero per cent
o If an assessment which is marked as pass/fail rather than given a percentage mark is submitted later than the deadline, the work will immediately be marked as a fail
* The University wants you to do your best. However, we know that sometimes events happen which mean that you can’t submit your coursework by the deadline – these events should be beyond your control and not easy to predict.  If this happens, you can apply for an extension to your deadline for up to five working days, or if you need longer, you can apply for a deferral, which takes you to the next assessment period (for example, to the re-sit period following the main Assessment Boards). You must apply before the deadline for your assessment. You will find information about applying for extensions and deferrals here.
* Students MUST keep a copy and/or an electronic file of their assignment.
* Checks will be made on your work using anti-plagiarism software and approved plagiarism checking websites.




Return of Marked Work

You can expect to have feedback returned to you on 9th February 2024 (15 working days). If for any reason there is a delay, you will be kept informed. Marks and feedback will be provided online via Turnitin. It is important that you access the feedback you receive as this will help to make improvements to your later work, you can request a meeting with your Module Leader or Personal Tutor to discuss your feedback in more detail. 

Marks will have been internally moderated only, and will therefore be provisional; your mark will be formally agreed later in the year once the external examiner has completed their review. More information on assessment and feedback can be found here.


Academic Integrity and Generative AI Use 

In submitting a piece of work for assessment it is essential that you understand the University's requirements for maintaining academic integrity and ensure that the work does not contravene University regulations. Some examples of behaviour that would not be considered acceptable include plagiarism, re-use of previously assessed work, collusion with others and purchasing your assignment from a third party. For more information on academic offences, bad academic practice, and academic penalties, please read chapter four of our academic regulations.

Generative AI tools cannot be used for this assessment. You must not use generative artificial intelligence (AI) to generate any materials or content in relation to your assessment. The only one exception is the use of AI to help the creation of the R script.


Any use of generative AI needs to be appropriately acknowledged. Students should add a statement explaining which technologies were used, how they were used and how this output was then used to complete the assignment. Direct use of outputs should be cited.

Examples of a student acknowledgement statement are shown below:

Statement of acknowledgment 1 - generative AI used when module leader allows it.

I have used (list all AI system (s) used and links e.g., Google’s Bard, https://bard.google.com) to (provide details of how you have used generative artificial intelligence e.g., to breakdown some of the concepts taught on the module). The prompt (s) I have used are (include the prompt (s) e.g., you are an enthusiastic tutor who is also an experienced economist, help me understand the concept of game theory with explanations and examples). What was generated from these prompts was used to (explain how they were used in your submission, e.g., develop a section on game theory exemplars).
Statement of acknowledgment 2 – generative AI not used when module leader allows it.
This assessment has not used any generative-AI.
You can find the library guide on generative AI use here - https://library.dmu.ac.uk/genai

Academic Support and Your Well-being

Referencing is the process of acknowledging other people’s work when you have used it in your assignment or research. It allows the reader to locate your source material as quickly and easily as possible so that they can read these sources themselves and verify the validity of your arguments. Referencing provides the link between what you write and the evidence on which it is based.
You identify the sources that you have used by citing them in the text of your assignment (called citations or in-text citations) and referencing them at the end of your assignment (called the reference list or end-text citations). The reference list only includes the sources cited in your text. The main referencing guide can be found here and includes information on the basics of referencing and achieving good academic practice. It also has tabs for the specific referencing styles depending on whether you require Harvard style used in business or OSCOLA style used by the Law school.
The University has a wealth of support services available to students; further information can be obtained from Student Gateway, the Student Advice Centre, Library and Learning Services and, most importantly, your Personal Tutor. If you are struggling with your assessments and/or deadlines please do seek help as soon as possible so that appropriate support and guidance can be identi?ed and put in place for you. More information can be found on the Healthy DMU pages.

2. Introduction to R

Long Tutorial
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf



Quick tutorial - RStudio Screen
a. After installing R and RStudio, open Rstudio.



b. Let's choose a better appeareance for our RStudio. Click on "Tools" and then "Global Options."

c. Afterwards, in the window "Options", click on "Appearance", RStudio theme: "Modern", Editor font: "Courier", Editor theme: Cobalt. Finally, click on "Apply"



d. Now, we want to open a file to save what we are going to learn during this session. Click on 'File', 'New File', and 'R Script'; or simply press Ctrl+Shift+N; this will open a new panel called 'Script' where we are going to write the commands for R. The name of the script is Untitled 1. At the end of this session save the script in a folder for this module.


e. Let's learn how to write our own comments in our R code/ script. On the script panel, type the caracter # and then write 'LAB ONE – ECON2545 – AND THE DATE TODAY'. R will ignore any line of command starting with #. You can use # to add comments, titles, reminders within your R code/ R Script.


The usual Rstudio screen has four windows: 1. Console. 2. Environment and history. 3. Files, plots, packages and help. 4. The R script(s) and data view. The R script is where you keep a record of your work. For Stata users this would be like the do-file, for SPSS users is like the syntax and for SAS users the SAS program.

f. Let's type 'getwd()' in line number 2 and hit the keys' ctrl' and 'enter' in your keyboard at the same time. If you did this correctly you will see in the console panel the folder that R is using to download and upload data.
 
g. Let's create a folder in Windows for your course using File Explorer. I called my folder 'R code – LABs'. Afterwards, in RStudio' go to 'Session', 'Set Working Directory', and 'Choose Directory', afterwards, select the folder 'R code – LABs' or the name you used.

 
The above will result in code within the console, the code is setwd(and a path/directory to the folder in your computer). Copy and paste that in your R code; next time will only need to hit 'ctrl' and 'enter' to set the directory where you are going to work.

Copy and paste the outcome of you console in your R code; next time you will only need to hit 'ctrl' and 'enter' to set working directory.


h. In line number 4, type 5*5 and hit 'ctrl' and 'enter', the console will show the code and the result, 25.
i. Let's create a matrix; use the lines 5 and 6 in your script and hit 'ctrl' & 'enter' to line 5 and then 6.

If you did it correctly, the outcome in the console will be as follows:

In the line 5, you asked R to create a matrix called 'A', with numbers from 1 to 8, with four rows and two columns. 

Have a look at the 'Environment' panel, you can see in there all active objects(e.g. matrix A), and the panel 'History' shows a list of commands used do far.


To see the matrix A in a new window, type the command View(A) in line 7 and hit the keys' ctrl’&’enter' to run line 7. Afterwards, come back to your R script 'Untitled 1'.


Packages tab
The package tab shows the list of add-ons included in the installation of RStudio. If checked, the package is loaded into R, if not, any command related to that package won't work, you will need select it. You can also install other add-ons by clicking on the 'Install Packages' icon. 
Another way to install add-ons is to type the command install.packages("name of the package"), and then you will be able to open the library of commands of that package.
In line 8, to install the package forecast, type install.packages(“forecast”) and hit ctrl+enter. In the next window, you can hit yes to restart RStudio. See the picture below, you shall not get errors in the console, and at the end, the sign '>' will let you know the instalation run OK.


You must activate the package by typing, for example, library(forecast). This will automatically check the 'forecast' package.



We will use the package forecast in this course to analyse and predict economic time series.

Do not forget to save your R script in your own course folder! Use the icon to save, I called my file "lab001" and now is available by clicking on here, folder 'R code – LABs'

Opening files from the book Principles of Econometrics with R
*This section is adapted from Hill, Griffiths, and Lim 2011

To open a data file for the Principles of Econometrics textbook, (Hill, Griffiths, and Lim 2011):

rm(list=ls()) # Caution: this clears the Environment
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ccolonescu/PoEdata")
      library(PoEdata)
data("andy") # makes the dataset "andy" ready to use ?andy	# shows information about the dataset
      # Show head of dataset, with variables as column names: head(andy)
# Show a few rows in dataset: some(andy)


Creating Graphs in R

R provides a suite of functions to create and customize graphs. Here's a brief overview:

Basic Plotting:
Function: plot()
Usage: To plot data points and lines.
Arguments:
x, y: Variables to be plotted.
xlab, ylab: Labels for x and y-axis.
type: Determines the style of the plot. Options include:
"p": Points only
"l": Lines only
"b": Both points and lines
"n": No plot, creates an empty graph. Useful as a foundation for other plot elements.

Plotting Mathematical Curves:
Function: curve()
Usage: To plot a curve based on a mathematical function over a specified range.
Example:
curve(x^1, from=-2, to=2, xlab="x", ylab="y = x" ) # Add another curve to the existing graph:
       curve(x^2, add = TRUE) #plot(1:100, type='n')
       curve(sqrt(x), from=0, to=100, xlab="x", ylab="y")

Key Argument:
“add”: If set to TRUE, the curve is added to an existing graph.

Adding Lines:
Function: abline()
Usage: To add lines defined by specific parameters to a graph.
Arguments:
a, b: Defines a line based on its intercept (a) and slope (b).
h: Specifies the y-value for drawing a horizontal line.
v: the x-value for drawing a vertical line. x-value for a vertical line; coef, the name of a simple linear regression object, which includes the intercept and slope of a regression line.
      plot(1:10, type="n") # creates an empty graph
# Add straight lines to graph: abline(a=8, b=-0.5, h=3.5, v=4) curve(x^2, from=0, to=20) abline(v=10)

Examples of using the function ‘abline()‘

Using ChatGPT to Write and Debug Simple R Scripts

Introduction
This lab will guide students through the process of writing and debugging simple R scripts with the assistance of ChatGPT. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced R user, ChatGPT can provide valuable insights and help streamline your coding process.

Prerequisites
* Basic understanding of R syntax and programming concepts.
* R and RStudio installed on your computer.

Writing R Scripts with ChatGPT

Step 1: Define Your Objective
Start by clearly stating what you want to achieve with your R script. For example:
"I want to calculate the mean of a numeric vector."
"I need to create a histogram of a dataset."

Step 2: Ask ChatGPT for Code Snippets
Once your objective is clear, ask ChatGPT for a code snippet that accomplishes your task. For instance:

"Can you provide an R script to calculate the mean of a vector?"
"Show me how to create a histogram in R."

Ask ChatGPT: "Can you provide an R script to calculate the mean of a numeric vector?"

ChatGPT might provide a snippet like this:


Step 3: Analyze the Provided Code
ChatGPT will give you a code snippet. Read through it carefully and make sure you understand each part. You can ask ChatGPT to explain any lines or functions that are unclear.

Step 4: Run the Code in RStudio
Copy the code snippet into RStudio (use an script) and run it. Observe the output to see if it meets your expectations.

Debugging R Scripts with ChatGPT

Step 1: Identify the Problem
If the code doesn't work as expected, identify the error message or the unexpected output. For example:

Error messages in the console.
Results that don’t match your expectations.

You run the script, but you receive an error: Error in mean(height): object 'height' not found.

Step 2: Ask ChatGPT for Help
Describe the problem to ChatGPT. Be specific about the error or the issue. For example:

"I received an error message that says 'object not found'. What does this mean?"
"The histogram is not displaying any data. Can you help me fix it?"
"I tried to calculate the mean of a vector, but I got an error saying 'object not found'. Here's my code..."

Step 3: Implement the Suggested Solutions
ChatGPT will suggest solutions or ask further questions to clarify the issue. Follow the suggestions step by step, adjusting your code as needed.

ChatGPT might respond with: "It looks like there's a typo in your code. The object you're trying to calculate the mean for is 'heights', not 'height'."

Step 4: Test the Adjusted Code
After implementing the changes, rerun your script. If issues persist, describe the new output to ChatGPT, and continue the debugging process.



Best Practices for Using ChatGPT with R

* Incremental Development: Write and test your code in small chunks to catch errors early.
* Clear Communication: When asking for help, provide clear and detailed information about your code and the issues you're facing.
* Understanding Over Copy-Pasting: Try to understand the code snippets provided rather than just copying and pasting them. This will improve your R programming skills over time.

Conclusion
With the above steps, you can effectively use ChatGPT to write and debug simple R scripts. Remember, practice is key to becoming proficient in R, and using ChatGPT can accelerate your learning by providing instant assistance and feedback.

Lab 5 – Intro to Refinitiv
Workshop – Introduction to Refinitiv Eikon
Adapted from Darren Sparkes and Tom Webster’s ACFI3307

Complete the following activities to set up your Refinitiv Workspace account and learn the software's features.

Activity 1.
As a registered student on the ECON2545 module you should have received an email from Refinitiv that gives you your user ID (should be your DMU email address) and a link for you to access Refinitiv workspace as in Figure 1 below (Fig. 1). If you do not seem to have received this email then please check your junk and/or spam folders. If you still think that you have not received the email then please contact me by email to let me know cam.calderon@dmu.ac.uk
Please be aware that ‘Refinitiv Workspace’ is compatible with Google Chrome and Apple Safari. If you are on a Microsoft Windows computer please download Chrome to your device if you do not use it already. You may need to make it your default browser for the purposes of setting up Refinitiv Eikon after which you can reset back to your usual default browser, remembering that you will need to use Chrome whenever using Refinitv Eikon.
Fig. 1




Activity 2.
You will be taken to Chrome to set up a password to use with your ID as in Fig. 2 below. Please ensure that you choose a password that you can remember and/or write it down somewhere (perhaps on your phone) so that you will be able to access Eikon in the future.

As sown in Fig. 16, Refinitiv have a series of training videos for you to watch that will cover how to use the Refinitiv software. Most of these are only a couple of minutes long. The first time that you click on a video you will be asked to sign in with your DMU EMAIL ADDRESS.
The training videos will enhance your ability to use the software and will, therefore, directly impact upon your ability to manage your presentation assignment and final examination. However, I recommend that once you have signed in, you go to Activity 11 to view the videos as part of the user ‘Certification’ process rather than doing them as a standalone exercise.

Fig. 16



Activity 11.
Refinitiv also has a user ‘Certification’ qualification. This can be accessed from the menu bar as shown in Fig.18.
Fig. 18


Fig. 19

	
The ‘Certification’ screen, as shown in Fig.19, gives details on how to complete the certificate. In brief, to obtain certification status, you must complete training videos and e-learning modules and then pass a 60-minute test including 30 multiple-choice questions. You will need to select the Eikon Product Certification (Fig 19.) and this will take you to the required Learning Materials.

Students must begin to complete the Refinitiv Workspace certification during the lab. Not only will this help students for their assessment, but it will also enhance their CVs for presentation to potential employers.
Fig.19



Activity 12.
Continue to work through the Refinitv Eikon training materials and explore the software as part of your self-study. The quicker you become familiar with using the software, the easier you will find our labs throughout the academic year.

Activity 13.

Workshop – Terminal Access to Bloomberg

This is an OPTIONAL material; students can download the lab for Access to Bloomberg Terminals access in bb, folder ‘LABs’ Handbook’. The lab can also be downloaded from the shared folder for  on this link. 


Lab 6 – Refinitiv :News, forecasts, Macrox
Open the user manual on bb, module site, find the folder ‘Labs’. Students must cover pages 9 to 13; “Setting up Thomson Reuters Eikon”.

Activity 1 – Read the news for the UK.
In the search box, type ‘TOPNEWS’ and also ‘TOPNWS’. Within ‘TOPNEWS’, discuss the news you are following with your colleagues and review’ trending topics’. Explore further the labels of this app. Search ‘IFR Markets’  in google; what it is? Click under the label ‘Markets’ and click on IFR and review the ‘Refinitiv NEWSCASTS’ for interesting international financing review briefings. Finally, create your own new Refinitiv Digest.



Activity 2 – Find upcoming forecasts for the upcoming and highly important US economic events for w/c 1 Nov.

Explore economic news from specific groups of markets or countries. Use the Economic Monitor by typing ‘EM’. Apply filters to perform this activity.



Activity 3 – Discuss with your peers: in what country would you invest your savings today? 
Explore the Economics Application’ EC’. Investors usually use this top-down approach to choose whether to invest in a specific market. In what country would you invest your savings?

Activity 4 – Interesting shares to invest
The application ‘MACROX’ provides outstanding visual elements. In the tab ‘REGION’ and ‘countries and regions in Universe’ choose Europe; then go to the tab ‘SECTOR’ and select ‘Internet and Catalog Retail’; afterwards, click on the tab ‘SECURITY’ and sort the companies by ‘COMPANY MARKET CAP (USD)’. Browse for some attractive shares to invest in. 

Activity 5 – Are we going to get negative interest rates in the UK? I thought so one year ago; however, after recent developments in the supply side, it would look more appropriate a hawkish stance. Are we going to get higher interest rates next year in the UK?

- Review forecasts of Centrals Bank’s interest rates. Use the application Central Bank Poll ’CBP.’
- ‘US FED INTEREST’ provides more detailed information relevant to Central Banks.
