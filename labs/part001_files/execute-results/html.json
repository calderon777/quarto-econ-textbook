Install R and RStudio on your laptops/gadgets\n\nRStudio is a wrapper for R; we are using RStudio because it makes looks R more organised and straightforward. Follow the following instructions:\n\n- go to www.r-project.com\n\n- click on 'CRAN mirror'\n\n- choose one of the two UK mirrors - https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/ or https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/\n\n- Click on 'Download R for Windows' or 'Download R for macOS'\n\n- Click on 'install R for the first time\n\n- Click on 'Download R-... for Windows', the current version is R-4..5.1. Or alternatively, download the executable file for macOS. \n\n- double-click the downloaded file, then click on 'Run', 'language:English', 'OK', and read and follow the instructions of installation until you click on 'Next' for installing and 'Finish'\n\nThen proceed to Installing RStudio.\n\n- Go to rstudio.com\n\n- click on 'download'\n\n- download the Free version, download RStudio for Windows or macOS\n\n- Click on 'Next' if you agree and on 'Install' and 'Finish' to complete the process.\n\n\n\n### Introduction to R\n\n**Long Tutorial**\n\nWe would cover a brief introduction on this labs, students would like to cover a longer tutorial to get use to R quickly. Click on this link: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf\n\n\n**Quick tutorial - RStudio Screen**\n\nYou need to have installed R and RStudio to continue with this lab. \n\n- Open Rstudio in your computer.\n\n![On this picture, there are three panels 'the Console', 'The Environment', and 'The Plots, Help and Files' panel.](/images/image7a.png)\n\n- Let's choose a better appeareance for our RStudio. Click on \"Tools\" and then \"Global Options.\"\n\n![Image 5](/images/image8.png)\n\n- Afterwards, in the window \"Options\", click on \"Appearance\", RStudio theme: \"Modern\", Editor font: \"Courier\", Editor theme: Cobalt. Finally, click on \"Apply\"\n\n![Image 6](/images/image9.png)\n\n- Now, we want to open a file to save the code that we are learning during this session. Click on 'File', 'New File', and 'R Script'; or simply press Ctrl+Shift+N; this will open a new panel called 'Script' where we are going to write the commands for R. The name of the script is Untitled 1. At the end of this session save the script in a folder for this module.\n\n![Image 7](/images/image10.png)\n\nLet's learn how to write our own comments in our R code/ script. \n\n- On the script panel, type the caracter # and then write 'LAB ONE ‚Äì ECON2545 ‚Äì AND THE DATE TODAY'. \n\nR will ignore any line of command starting with #. You can use # to add comments, titles, reminders within your R code/ R Script.\n\n![Image 8](/images/image11.png)\n\nThe Rstudio screen has four windows or panels: 1. Console. 2. Environment and history. 3. Files, plots, packages and help. 4. The R script(s) and data view. The R script is where you keep a record of your work or commands - in a line by line basis. For Stata users this would be like the do-file, for SPSS users is like the syntax and for SAS users the SAS program.\n\n- Let's type 'getwd()' in line number '2' and hit the keys 'ctrl+enter' in your keyboard at the same time. If you did this correctly you will see in the console panel the folder or working directory that R is using to download and upload data.\n\n![Image 9](/images/image12.png)\n\nLet's create a folder in Windows for your course using File Explorer. I called my folder 'R code ‚Äì LABs'. Afterwards, in RStudio' go to 'Session', 'Set Working Directory', and 'Choose Directory', afterwards, select the folder 'R code ‚Äì LABs' or the name you used.\n\n![Image 10](/images/image13.png)\n\nThe above will result in code within the 'Console', the code is setwd(and a path/directory to the folder in your computer). Copy and paste that in your R code; next time you will only need to hit 'ctrl+enter' to set the directory or folder where you are going to work in R.\n\n![Image 11](/images/image14.png)\n\n- Copy and paste the outcome of you console in your R code; next time you will only need to hit 'ctrl' and 'enter' to set working directory.\n\n![Image 12](/images/image15.png)\n\n- In line number 4, type 5*5 and hit 'ctrl' and 'enter', the console will show the code and the result, 25.\n\n- Let's create a matrix; use the lines 5 and 6 in your script and hit 'ctrl' & 'enter' to line 5 and then 6.\n\n![Image 13](/images/image16.png)\n\nIf you did it correctly, the outcome in the console will be as follows:\n\n![Image 14](/images/image17.png)\n\n- In the line 5, you asked R to create a matrix called 'A', with numbers from 1 to 8, with four rows and two columns.\n\nHave a look at the 'Environment' panel, you can see in there all active objects(e.g. matrix A), and the panel 'History' shows a list of commands used do far.\n\n![Image 15](/images/image18.png)\n\n- To see the matrix A in a new window, type the command View(A) in line 7 and hit the keys 'ctrl+ enter' to run line 7. Afterwards, come back to your R script 'Untitled 1'.\n\n![Image 16](/images/image19.png)\n\n**Packages tab**\n\nThe package tab shows the list of add-ons included in the installation of RStudio. If checked, the package is loaded into R, if not, any command related to that package won't work, you will need select it. You can also install other add-ons by clicking on the 'Install Packages' icon.\n\nAnother way to install add-ons is to type the command install.packages(\"name of the package\"), and then you will be able to open the library of commands of that package.\n\n- In line 8, to install the package forecast, type install.packages(‚Äúforecast‚Äù) and hit ctrl+enter. In the next window, you can hit yes to restart RStudio. See the picture below, you shall not get errors in the console, and at the end, the sign '>' will let you know the instalation run OK.\n\n![Image 17](/images/image20.png)\n\n### You must activate the package by typing, for example, library(forecast). This will automatically check the 'forecast' package.\n\n![Image 18](/images/image25.jpg)\n\n![Image 19](/images/image26.jpg)\n\n### We will use the package forecast in this course to analyse and predict economic time series.\n\n### Do not forget to save your R script in your own course folder! Use the icon to save, I called my file \"lab001\" and now is available , folder 'R code ‚Äì LABs'\n\n![Image 20](/images/image27.jpg)\n\n## Lab 1 ‚Äì R certification & Package swirl\n**Access LinkedIn Learning ‚Äì First time logging in **\n*****Adapted from the library resources\nOpen any web browser and navigate to\n\n![Image 21](/images/image28.jpg)\n\nEnter your DMU email address:\nFor students ‚Äì your login credentials will be your DMU email address in the format Pnumber@my365.dmu.ac.uk\nFor DMU staff this is your Outlook full email address.\n**Select Continue**\nSelect the 'Sign in with Single Sign On' blue button.\n\n![Image 22](/images/image29.jpg)\n\nYou will be taken to DMU's Single Sign in screen.

Go to the tile ‚ÄòAssessments‚Äô and click on ‚ÄúMock/Practice MCQs‚Äù. Students can take the test as many times they want. Each time, students will receive many new questions.\n\n### Using ChatGPT to Write and Debug Simple R Scripts\n\n### Introduction\nThis lab will guide students through the process of writing and debugging simple R scripts with the assistance of ChatGPT. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced R user, ChatGPT can provide valuable insights and help streamline your coding process.\n\n## Prerequisites\nBasic understanding of R syntax and programming concepts.\nR and RStudio installed on your computer.\n\n### Writing R Scripts with ChatGPT\n\n## Step 1: Define Your Objective\nStart by clearly stating what you want to achieve with your R script. For example:\n\"I want to calculate the mean of a numeric vector.\"\n\"I need to create a histogram of a dataset.\"\n\n## Step 2: Ask ChatGPT for Code Snippets\nOnce your objective is clear, ask ChatGPT for a code snippet that accomplishes your task. For instance:\n\"Can you provide an R script to calculate the mean of a vector?\"\n\"Show me how to create a histogram in R.\"\nAsk ChatGPT: \"Can you provide an R script to calculate the mean of a numeric vector?\"\nChatGPT might provide a snippet like this:\n\n![Image 46](/images/image49.png)\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the Provided Code\nChatGPT will give you a code snippet. Read through it carefully and make sure you understand each part. You can ask ChatGPT to explain any lines or functions that are unclear.\n\n## Step 4: Run the Code in RStudio\nCopy the code snippet into RStudio (use an script) and run it. Observe the output to see if it meets your expectations.\n\n### Debugging R Scripts with ChatGPT\n\n## Step 1: Identify the Problem\nIf the code doesn't work as expected, identify the error message or the unexpected output. For example:\nError messages in the console.\nResults that don‚Äôt match your expectations.\nYou run the script, but you receive an error: Error in mean(height): object 'height' not found.\n\n## Step 2: Ask ChatGPT for Help\nDescribe the problem to ChatGPT. Be specific about the error or the issue. For example:\n\"I received an error message that says 'object not found'. What does this mean?\"\n\"The histogram is not displaying any data. Can you help me fix it?\"\n\"I tried to calculate the mean of a vector, but I got an error saying 'object not found'. Here's my code...\"\n\n## Step 3: Implement the Suggested Solutions\nChatGPT will suggest solutions or ask further questions to clarify the issue. Follow the suggestions step by step, adjusting your code as needed.\nChatGPT might respond with: \"It looks like there's a typo in your code. The object you're trying to calculate the mean for is 'heights', not 'height'.\"\n\n## Step 4: Test the Adjusted Code\nAfter implementing the changes, rerun your script. If issues persist, describe the new output to ChatGPT, and continue the debugging process.\n\n![Image 47](/images/image5.png)\n\n### Best Practices for Using ChatGPT with R\nIncremental Development: Write and test your code in small chunks to catch errors early.\nClear Communication: When asking for help, provide clear and detailed information about your code and the issues you're facing.\nUnderstanding Over Copy-Pasting: Try to understand the code snippets provided rather than just copying and pasting them. This will improve your R programming skills over time.\n\n## Conclusion\nWith the above steps, you can effectively use ChatGPT to write and debug simple R scripts. Remember, practice is key to becoming proficient in R, and using ChatGPT can accelerate your learning by providing instant assistance and feedback.\nAdditional Resources\nHappy coding!\n\n## Lab 5 ‚Äì Intro to Refinitiv\n**Workshop ‚Äì Introduction to Refinitiv Eikon**\nAdapted from Darren Sparkes and Tom Webster‚Äôs ACFI3307\nComplete the following activities to set up your Refinitiv Workspace account and learn the software's features.\n**Activity 1.**\nAs a registered student on the ECON2545 module you should have received an email from Refinitiv that gives you your user ID (should be your DMU email address) and a link for you to access Refinitiv workspace as in Figure 1 below (Fig. 1). If you do not seem to have received this email then please check your junk and/or spam folders. If you still think that you have not received the email then please contact me by email to let me know\nPlease be aware that ‚ÄòRefinitiv Workspace‚Äô is compatible with Google Chrome and Apple Safari. If you are on a Microsoft Windows computer please download Chrome to your device if you do not use it already. You may need to make it your default browser for the purposes of setting up Refinitiv Eikon after which you can reset back to your usual default browser, remembering that you will need to use Chrome whenever using Refinitv Eikon.\n\n![Image 48](/images/image50.png)\n\n![Image 49](/images/image51.png)\n\n****\n**Activity 2.**\nYou will be taken to Chrome to set up a password to use with your ID as in Fig. 2 below. Please ensure that you choose a password that you can remember and/or write it down somewhere (perhaps on your phone) so that you will be able to access Eikon in the future.\n\n![Image 50](/images/image52.png)\n\n**Activity 3.**\n\n![Image 51](/images/image53.png)\n\n![Image 52](/images/image54.png)\n\n**Activity 4.**\n\n![Image 53](/images/image55.png)\n\n![Image 54](/images/image56.png)\n\n**Activity 5.**\n\n![Image 55](/images/image57.png)\n\n![Image 56](/images/image58.png)\n\nFig. 6\n\n![Image 57](/images/image59.png)\n\nFig. 7\n\n![Image 58](/images/image6.png)\n\n****\n**Activity 6.**\n\n![Image 59](/images/image60.png)\n\n![Image 60](/images/image61.png)\n\nFig. 9\n\n![Image 61](/images/image62.png)\n\n****\n**Activity 7.**\nYou should be presented with your home screen as in Fig. 10. If your screen does not look exactly the same as Fig. 10, there is no need to worry. You will have the chance to set your homescreen to what you want in the future.\nFig. 10\n\n![Image 62](/images/image63.png)\n\n**Activity 8.****\t****\t**\nFig 11.\n\n![Image 63](/images/image64.png)\n\n![Image 64](/images/image65.png)\n\n![Image 65](/images/image66.png)\n\n![Image 66](/images/image67.png)\n\n![Image 67](/images/image68.png)\n\n![Image 68](/images/image69.png)\n\n****\n\n![Image 69](/images/image7.png)\n\nFig. 14\n\n![Image 70](/images/image70.png)\n\n**Activity 10.**\n\n![Image 71](/images/image71.png)\n\n![Image 72](/images/image72.png)\n\nAs sown in Fig. 16, Refinitiv have a series of training videos for you to watch that will cover how to use the Refinitiv software. Most of these are only a couple of minutes long. The first time that you click on a video you will be asked to sign in with your **DMU EMAIL ADDRESS**.\nThe training videos will enhance your ability to use the software and will, therefore, **directly impact upon your ability to manage your ****presentation**** assignment**** and final examination**. However, I recommend that once you have signed in, you go to Activity 11 to view the videos as part of the user ‚ÄòCertification‚Äô process rather than doing them as a standalone exercise.\nFig. 16\n\n![Image 73](/images/image73.png)\n\n**Activity 11.**\nRefinitiv also has a user ‚ÄòCertification‚Äô qualification. This can be accessed from the menu bar as shown in Fig.18.\nFig. 18\n\n![Image 74](/images/image74.png)\n\nFig. 19\n\n![Image 75](/images/image8.png)\n\nThe ‚ÄòCertification‚Äô screen, as shown in Fig.19, gives details on how to complete the certificate. In brief, to obtain certification status, you must complete training videos and e-learning modules and then pass a 60-minute test including 30 multiple-choice questions. You will need to select the Eikon Product Certification (Fig 19.) and this will take you to the required Learning Materials.\nStudents must begin to complete the Refinitiv Workspace certification during the lab. Not only will this help students for their assessment, but it will also **enhance ****their**** CV****s**** for presentation to potential employers**.\nFig.19\n**Activity 12.**\nContinue to work through the Refinitv Eikon training materials and explore the software as part of your self-study. The quicker you become familiar with using the software, the easier you will find our labs throughout the academic year.\n**Activity 13.**\n\n![Image 76](/images/image9.png)\n\n**Workshop ‚Äì ****Terminal Access**** to Bloomberg**\nThis is an OPTIONAL material; students can download the lab for Access to Bloomberg Terminals access in bb, folder ‚ÄòLABs‚Äô Handbook‚Äô. The lab can also be downloaded from the shared folder for  on .\n\n## Lab 6 ‚Äì Refinitiv :News, forecasts, Macrox\nOpen the user manual on bb, module site, find the folder ‚ÄòLabs‚Äô. Students must cover pages 9 to 13; ‚ÄúSetting up Thomson Reuters Eikon‚Äù.\n\n## Activity 1 ‚Äì Read the news for the UK.\nIn the search box, type ‚ÄòTOPNEWS‚Äô and also ‚ÄòTOPNWS‚Äô. Within ‚ÄòTOPNEWS‚Äô, discuss the news you are following with your colleagues and review‚Äô trending topics‚Äô. Explore further the labels of this app. Search ‚ÄòIFR Markets‚Äô  in google; what it is? Click under the label ‚ÄòMarkets‚Äô and click on IFR and review the ‚ÄòRefinitiv NEWSCASTS‚Äô for interesting international financing review briefings. Finally, create your own new Refinitiv Digest.\n\n## Activity 2 ‚Äì Find upcoming forecasts for the upcoming and highly important US economic events for w/c 1 Nov.\nExplore economic news from specific groups of markets or countries. Use the Economic Monitor by typing ‚ÄòEM‚Äô. Apply filters to perform this activity.\n\n## Activity 3 ‚Äì Discuss with your peers: in what country would you invest your savings today?\nExplore the Economics Application‚Äô EC‚Äô. Investors usually use this top-down approach to choose whether to invest in a specific market. In what country would you invest your savings?\n\n## Activity 4 ‚Äì Interesting shares to invest\nThe application ‚ÄòMACROX‚Äô provides outstanding visual elements. In the tab ‚ÄòREGION‚Äô and ‚Äòcountries and regions in Universe‚Äô choose Europe; then go to the tab ‚ÄòSECTOR‚Äô and select ‚ÄòInternet and Catalog Retail‚Äô; afterwards, click on the tab ‚ÄòSECURITY‚Äô and sort the companies by ‚ÄòCOMPANY MARKET CAP (USD)‚Äô. Browse for some attractive shares to invest in.\n\n## Activity 5 ‚Äì Are we going to get negative interest rates in the UK? I thought so one year ago; however, after recent developments in the supply side, it would look more appropriate a hawkish stance. Are we going to get higher interest rates next year in the UK?\nReview forecasts of Centrals Bank‚Äôs interest rates. Use the application Central Bank Poll ‚ÄôCBP.‚Äô\n‚ÄòUS FED INTEREST‚Äô provides more detailed information relevant to Central Banks.\n\n\n---\n\n[‚¨ÖÔ∏è Previous](../index.html)‚ÄÉ|‚ÄÉ[Next ‚û°Ô∏è](part002.html)\n",
