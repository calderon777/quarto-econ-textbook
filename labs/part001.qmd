## Lab 5: Prerequisite - A Quick intro to R

### 💾 Install R and RStudio on your laptops/gadgets

RStudio is a wrapper for R; we are using RStudio because it makes looks R more organised and straightforward. Follow the following instructions:

- go to https://www.r-project.org

- click on 'CRAN mirror'

- choose one of the two UK mirrors - https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/ or https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/

- Click on 'Download R for Windows' or 'Download R for macOS'

- Click on 'install R for the first time

- Click on 'Download R-... for Windows', the current version is R-4..5.1. Or alternatively, download the executable file for macOS. 

- double-click the downloaded file, then click on 'Run', 'language:English', 'OK', and read and follow the instructions of installation until you click on 'Next' for installing and 'Finish'

Then proceed to Installing RStudio.

- Go to rstudio.com

- click on 'download'

- download the Free version, download RStudio for Windows or macOS

- Click on 'Next' if you agree and on 'Install' and 'Finish' to complete the process.

### 📘 Introduction to R
After downloading and installing open RStudio, we will cover now some tutorials. 

👨‍💻 **Long Tutorial**

We would cover a brief introduction on this labs, students would like to cover a longer tutorial to get use to R quickly. Click on this link: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf


👨‍💻 **Quick tutorial - RStudio Screen**

You need to have installed R and RStudio to continue with this lab. 

- Open Rstudio in your computer.

![On this picture, there are three panels 'the Console', 'The Environment', and 'The Plots, Help and Files' panel.](/images/image7a.png)

- Let's choose a better appeareance for our RStudio. Click on "Tools" and then "Global Options."

![In RStudio, click on 'Tools' and 'Global Options'](/images/image8.png)

- Afterwards, in the window "Options", click on "Appearance", RStudio theme: "Modern", Editor font: "Courier", Editor theme: Cobalt. Finally, click on "Apply"

![You are here by clicking on Tools>Global Options..>Appereance>Modern>Courier>Cobalt>Apply](/images/image9.png)

- Now, we want to open a file to save the code that we are learning during this session. Click on 'File', 'New File', and 'R Script'; or simply press Ctrl+Shift+N; this will open a new panel called 'Script' where we are going to write the commands for R. The name of the script is Untitled 1. At the end of this session save the script in a folder for this module.

![Click on File>New File>R Script](/images/image10.png)

Let's learn how to write our own comments in our R code/ script. 

- On the script panel, type the caracter `#` and then write `'LAB ONE – ECON2545 – AND THE DATE TODAY'`. 

R will ignore any line of command starting with `#`. You can use `#` to add comments, titles, reminders within your R code/ R Script. If you did it right, your R Script shall look like this:

![Comments are crucial to learn R](/images/image11.png)

The Rstudio screen has four windows or panels: 1. Console. 2. Environment and history. 3. Files, plots, packages and help. 4. The R script(s) and data view. The R script is where you keep a record of your work or commands - in a line by line basis. For Stata users this would be like the do-file, for SPSS users is like the syntax and for SAS users the SAS program.

- Let's type `getwd()` in line number '2' and hit the keys 'ctrl+enter' in your keyboard at the same time - The + indicates 'do it at the same time', you dont need to press the key '+'  . If you did this correctly you will see in the console panel the folder or working directory that R is using to download and upload data.

![This image shows how your R Script should look and the outcome in the console -bottom panel after using ctrl+enter](/images/image12.png)

Let's create a folder in Windows for your course using 📁 File Explorer. I called my folder 'R code – LABs'. Afterwards, in RStudio' go to 'Session', 'Set Working Directory', 'Choose Directory', and select the folder 'R code – LABs' or the name you used.

![Create your folder and then click on Session>Set Working Directory>Choose Directory](/images/image13.png)

The above will render a result within the 'Console' panel, this is the code `setwd(and a path/directory to your chosen folder in your computer)`. Copy and paste that in your R code; next time you will only need to hit 'ctrl+enter' on 'setwd(your directory)' to set the directory or folder where you are going to work in R.

![This is the code you shall copy and paste in your R Script, ignore '>'](/images/image14.png)

- Copy and paste the outcome of you console in your R code; next time you will only need to hit 'ctrl' and 'enter' to set working directory.

![setwd() example in your R Script](/images/image15.png)

- In line number 4, type `5*5` and hit 'ctrl' and 'enter', the console will show the code and the result, 25.

- Let's also create a matrix. Use the in the picture below -lines 5 and 6, put them on your script and hit ctrl+enter to line 5 and then 6.

![A multiplication and your first matrix](/images/image16.png)

If you did it correctly, the outcome in the console will be as follows:

![Multiplication and matrix output in your Console](/images/image17.png)

- In the line 5, you asked R to create a matrix called 'A', with numbers from 1 to 8, with four rows and two columns.

Have a look at the 'Environment' panel, you can see in there all active objects(e.g. matrix A), and the panel 'History' shows a list of commands used do far.

![Environment Panel](/images/image18.png)

- To see the matrix A in a new window, type the command `View(A)` in line 7 and hit the keys 'ctrl+enter' to run line 7, this will send you to a different tab. Afterwards, come back to your R script by clicking on 'Untitled 1'.

![Sample of function View()](/images/image19.png)

**Packages tab**

The package tab shows the list of add-ons included in the installation of RStudio. If checked, the package is loaded into R, if not, any command related to that package won't work, you will need select it. You can also install other add-ons by clicking on the 'Install Packages' icon.

Another way to install add-ons is to type the function `install.packages("name of the package")`, and then you will be able to open the library of commands of that package.

- In line 8, to install the package forecast, type `install.packages(“forecast”)` and hit ctrl+enter. In the next window, you can hit yes to restart RStudio. See the picture below, you shall not get errors in the console, and at the end, the sign '>' will let you know the instalation run OK.

![Function install.packages() and installing package 'forecast'](/images/image20.png)

You must activate the package by typing 'library(the package)', for example, `library(forecast)` and ctrl+enter. In this case, this will automatically open all functions within the 'forecast' package.

![library() function and sample with package 'forecast'](/images/image21.png)

![The Console will show this result after 'running' library("forecast")](/images/image22.png)

We will use the package forecast in this course to analyse and predict economic time series.

**Script/Data View Window:**

•	Begin scripts with a comment for title and description using the hash character (#). Anything after the hash on the same line is considered a comment and is ignored by R.
•	Code can continue to the next line without a special character, but only if the previous line ends in a way that suggests continuation (e.g., a comma or unclosed brackets).
•	To run a line of code, position the cursor on the line and press Ctrl+Enter. For multiple lines, select them and press Ctrl+Enter.


**Console/Output Window:**

•	It's recommended to work in script mode for reusability.
•	Commands outside the script context can be typed at the bottom of the console, indicated by the ">" sign.
•	Press Enter to execute a command.
•	Use the up and down arrows to revisit and edit older lines of code previously typed into the console.


**Do not forget** to 💾 save your R script in your own course folder! Use the icon to save, I called my file "lab001" and now is available , folder 'R code – LABs'

![Remember to save your R Scripts, this will save you a lot time!](/images/image23.png)

### 📈 Creating Graphs in R
R provides a suite of functions to create and customize graphs. Here's a brief overview:

**Basic Plotting:**
Function: plot()
Usage: To plot data points and lines.
Arguments:
x, y: Variables to be plotted.
xlab, ylab: Labels for x and y-axis.
type: Determines the style of the plot. Options include:
"p": Points only
"l": Lines only
"b": Both points and lines
"n": No plot, creates an empty graph. Useful as a foundation for other plot elements.


### 🔢 Plotting Mathematical Curves:
Function: curve()
Usage: To plot a curve based on a mathematical function over a specified range.
Example:
Key Argument:
“add”: If set to TRUE, the curve is added to an existing graph.

```{r}
# Plot the first curve: y = x
curve(x^1, from = -2, to = 2, xlab = "x", ylab = "y", ylim = c(-2, 10))

# Add a second curve: y = x^2
curve(x^2, add = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# y = sqrt(x)
# This function is only defined for x ≥ 0
curve(sqrt(x), from = 0, to = 10)

```

### 📉 Adding Lines:
Function: abline()
Usage: To add lines defined by specific parameters to a graph.
Arguments:
a, b: Defines a line based on its intercept (a) and slope (b).
h: Specifies the y-value for drawing a horizontal line.
v: the x-value for drawing a vertical line. *x*-value for a vertical line; coef, the name of a simple linear regression object, which includes the intercept and slope of a regression line.

```{r}
plot(1:10, type="n") # creates an empty graph
abline(a=8, b=-0.5, h=3.5, v=4) # Add straight lines to graph 
curve(x^2, from=0, to=20) 
abline(v=10)
```

Let's explore R datasets using a basic level tutorial in visualisation. We will work in RStudio. You can type `data()` and enter in the RStudio console, this opens a new tab with very interesting datasets. 
```{r}
data()  #Explore the built-in datasets
```

Now, load the built-in dataset 'airquality' into RStudio - type `data(airquality)` in the console:

```{r}
data(airquality)
```

If everything is OK, in the console panel you will see the airquality dataset.

Let's perform data exploration.
```{r}
str(airquality) #the function 'str()' displays the internal structure of an R object
```

The output of `str(airquality)` shows the numer of observations (153) and number of variables (6). There is also information about variable names, type integer (int) or number (num), and a some sample observations.

We can also Explore the beginning of the data and the end of the data with the funcions `head()` and `tail()`. 
```{r}
head(airquality, 7)

tail(airquality,5)
```

**Descriptive statistics**

One easy way to check for key descriptive statistics is to use the function `summary()`, check this descriptive statitics for the dataset 'ariquality' as follows:

```{r}
summary(airquality)
```


Use the `graphics` for plotting basic graphs. Plot the ozone column from airquality. Plot a graph between ozone and wind to visualise a possible relation. Is there a negative correlation between ozone and air speed?

```{r}
library(help = "graphics")
plot(airquality$Ozone)
plot(airquality$Ozone, airquality$Wind)
```

Plot the entire dataset. Is there a positive correlation between temperature and ozone level?

```{r}
plot(airquality)
```

You can also plot graphs 'points and lines' or 'high density lines' graphs.

```{r}
plot(airquality$Ozone, type= "b")
plot(airquality$Ozone, type= "h")
```

Now, type `?plot()`, this will open the help for the function `plot()`. It is important to read this help files as they have many more arguments that you can use when using the functions.

We can also change graph labels and titles:
```{r}
plot(airquality$Ozone, xlab = 'ozone Concentration', ylab = 'No of Instances', main = 'Ozone levels in NY city', col = 'green')
```


The following code shows how to create Horizontal bar plots, vertical bar plots:

```{r}
barplot(airquality$Ozone, main = 'Ozone Concenteration in air',xlab = 'ozone levels', col= 'green',horiz = TRUE)
barplot(airquality$Ozone, main = 'Ozone Concenteration in air',xlab = 'ozone levels', col='red',horiz = FALSE)
hist(airquality$Solar.R, main = 'Solar Radiation values in air',xlab = 'Solar rad.', col='red')
```

We can also create a histogram of the column solar radiation. Try to explain the output:
```{r}
hist(airquality$Solar.R)
```

Let's generate a boxplot of solar radiation. Explain the output.

```{r}
boxplot(airquality[,0:4], main='Multiple Box plots')
```

Now, generate a grid 3x3 chart:

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(3,3), mar=c(2,5,2,1), las=1, bty="n")
plot(airquality$Ozone)
plot(airquality$Ozone, airquality$Wind)
plot(airquality$Ozone, type= "c")
plot(airquality$Ozone, type= "s")
plot(airquality$Ozone, type= "h")
barplot(airquality$Ozone, main = 'Ozone Concenteration in air',xlab = 'ozone levels', col='green',horiz = TRUE)
hist(airquality$Solar.R)
boxplot(airquality$Solar.R)
boxplot(airquality[,0:4], main='Multiple Box plots')
```


Other visualisation packages include lattice (good for kernel density plots) , ggplot2, plotty, maps (to plot country maps). Explore more on the link:https://towardsdatascience.com/a-guide-to-data-visualisation-in-r-for-beginners-ef6d41a34174

## Lab 9 - Mock/Practice test & AI AND R

### 📝 MOCK/PRACTICE TEST
Go to the module site in the LZ. Go to the tile ‘Assessments’ and click on “Mock/Practice MCQs”. Students can take the test as many times they want. Each time, students will receive many new questions.

### 🤖 Using AI (e.g. ChatGPT) to Write and Debug Simple R Scripts

**Introduction**
This lab will guide students through the process of writing and debugging simple R scripts with the assistance of ChatGPT. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced R user, ChatGPT can provide valuable insights and help streamline your coding process.

**Prerequisites**
Basic understanding of R syntax and programming concepts.
R and RStudio installed on your computer.

**Writing R Scripts with ChatGPT**

**👣 Step 1: Define Your Objective**
Start by clearly stating what you want to achieve with your R script. For example:
"I want to calculate the mean of a numeric vector."
"I need to create a histogram of a dataset."

**👣 Step 2: Ask ChatGPT for Code Snippets**
Once your objective is clear, ask ChatGPT for a code snippet that accomplishes your task. For instance:

"Can you provide an R script to calculate the mean of a vector?"

"Show me how to create a histogram in R."

Ask ChatGPT: "Can you provide an R script to calculate the mean of a numeric vector?"

ChatGPT might provide a snippet like this:

![Sample snippet in Chatgpt about R](/images/image51.png)

**👣Step 3: Analyze the Provided Code**
ChatGPT will give you a code snippet. Read through it carefully and make sure you understand each part. You can ask ChatGPT to explain any lines or functions that are unclear.

**👣 Step 4: Run the Code in RStudio**

Copy the code snippet into RStudio (use an script) and run it. Observe the output to see if it meets your expectations.

### 🐞 Debugging R Scripts with ChatGPT

**👣 Step 1: Identify the Problem**

If the code doesn't work as expected, identify the error message or the unexpected output. For example:

- Error messages in the console.
- Results that don’t match your expectations.
- You run the script, but you receive an error: Error in mean(height): object 'height' not found.

**👣 Step 2: Ask ChatGPT for Help**
Describe the problem to ChatGPT. Be specific about the error or the issue. For example:

- "I received an error message that says 'object not found'. What does this mean?"
- "The histogram is not displaying any data. Can you help me fix it?"
- "I tried to calculate the mean of a vector, but I got an error saying 'object not found'. 
- Here's my code..."

**👣 Step 3: Implement the Suggested Solutions**
ChatGPT will suggest solutions or ask further questions to clarify the issue. Follow the suggestions step by step, adjusting your code as needed.
ChatGPT might respond with: "It looks like there's a typo in your code. The object you're trying to calculate the mean for is 'heights', not 'height'."

**👣 Step 4: Test the Adjusted Code**
After implementing the changes, rerun your script. If issues persist, describe the new output to ChatGPT, and continue the debugging process.

![Ask AI to adjust your code](/images/image52.png)

**Best Practices for Using ChatGPT with R**
Incremental Development: Write and test your code in small chunks to catch errors early.
Clear Communication: When asking for help, provide clear and detailed information about your code and the issues you're facing.
Understanding Over Copy-Pasting: Try to understand the code snippets provided rather than just copying and pasting them. This will improve your R programming skills over time.

**Conclusion**
With the above steps, you can effectively use ChatGPT to write and debug simple R scripts. Remember, practice is key to becoming proficient in R, and using ChatGPT can accelerate your learning by providing instant assistance and feedback.

## Lab 10 – Introduction to Refinitiv Workspace (LSEG)

**Workshop – Introduction to Refinitiv Eikon**

Adapted from: *Darren Sparkes and Tom Webster’s ACFI3307*

**Complete the following activities to set up your Refinitiv Workspace account and learn the software's features.**

**Activity 1.**
If registered, you should have received an email from Refinitiv that gives you your user ID (should be your DMU email address) and a link for you to access Refinitiv workspace as in Figure 1 below (Fig. 1). If you do not seem to have received this email then please check your junk and/or spam folders. If you still think that you have not received the email then please contact me by email to let me know at `cam.calderon@dmu.ac.uk`

Please be aware that ‘Refinitiv Workspace’ is compatible with Google Chrome and Apple Safari. If you are on a Microsoft Windows computer please download Chrome to your device if you do not use it already. You may need to make it your default browser for the purposes of setting up Refinitiv Eikon after which you can reset back to your usual default browser, remembering that you will need to use Chrome whenever using Refinitv Eikon.

![Welcome email](/images/image53.png)

**Activity 2.**
You will be taken to Chrome to set up a password to use with your ID as in Fig. 2 below. Please ensure that you choose a password that you can remember and/or write it down somewhere (perhaps on your phone) so that you will be able to access Eikon in the future.

![Note password requirements](/images/image54.png)

**Activity 3.**

![Select 'Open in Web'](/images/image55.png)

**Activity 4.**

![Your choice!](/images/image56.png)

**Activity 5.**

![About you!](/images/image57.png)

![Select 'Student'](/images/image58.png)

![Your profile](/images/image59.png)

**Activity 6.**

![Work through the 'Welcome' app features ](/images/image60.png)

![Features](/images/image61.png)

**Activity 7.**
You should be presented with your home screen. If your screen does not look exactly the same, there is no need to worry. You will have the chance to set your homescreen to what you want in the future.

![Image 64](/images/image64.png)

![Image 65](/images/image65.png)

**Activity 9**

![Image 66](/images/image66.png)

**Activity 10**

![Image 67](/images/image67.png)


As sown in Fig. 16, Refinitiv have a series of training videos for you to watch that will cover how to use the Refinitiv software. Most of these are only a couple of minutes long. The first time that you click on a video you will be asked to sign in with your **DMU EMAIL ADDRESS**.
The training videos will enhance your ability to use the software and will, therefore, **directly impact upon your ability to manage your ****presentation**** assignment**** and final examination**. However, I recommend that once you have signed in, you go to Activity 11 to view the videos as part of the user ‘Certification’ process rather than doing them as a standalone exercise.

![Image 68](/images/image68.png)


**Activity 11.**
Refinitiv also has a user ‘Certification’ qualification. This can be accessed from the menu bar as shown in Fig.18.

![Image 74](/images/image69.png)


![Image 75](/images/image70.png)

The ‘Certification’ screen, as shown in Fig.19, gives details on how to complete the certificate. In brief, to obtain certification status, you must complete training videos and e-learning modules and then pass a 60-minute test including 30 multiple-choice questions. You will need to select the Eikon Product Certification (Fig 19.) and this will take you to the required Learning Materials.

Students must begin to complete the Refinitiv Workspace certification during the lab. Not only will this help students for their assessment, but it will also enhance their CV's for presentation to potential employers.

**Activity 12.**
Continue to work through the Refinitv Eikon training materials and explore the software as part of your self-study. The quicker you become familiar with using the software, the easier you will find our labs throughout the academic year.

![Image 76](/images/image71.png)


**Activity 13.**

![Image 76](/images/image9.png)

**Workshop – ****Terminal Access**** to Bloomberg**
This is an OPTIONAL material; students can download the lab for Access to Bloomberg Terminals access in bb, folder ‘LABs’ Handbook’. The lab can also be downloaded from the shared folder for  on .

## Lab 6 – Refinitiv :News, forecasts, Macrox
Open the user manual on bb, module site, find the folder ‘Labs’. Students must cover pages 9 to 13; “Setting up Thomson Reuters Eikon”.

## Activity 1 – Read the news for the UK.
In the search box, type ‘TOPNEWS’ and also ‘TOPNWS’. Within ‘TOPNEWS’, discuss the news you are following with your colleagues and review’ trending topics’. Explore further the labels of this app. Search ‘IFR Markets’  in google; what it is? Click under the label ‘Markets’ and click on IFR and review the ‘Refinitiv NEWSCASTS’ for interesting international financing review briefings. Finally, create your own new Refinitiv Digest.

## Activity 2 – Find upcoming forecasts for the upcoming and highly important US economic events for w/c 1 Nov.
Explore economic news from specific groups of markets or countries. Use the Economic Monitor by typing ‘EM’. Apply filters to perform this activity.

## Activity 3 – Discuss with your peers: in what country would you invest your savings today?
Explore the Economics Application’ EC’. Investors usually use this top-down approach to choose whether to invest in a specific market. In what country would you invest your savings?

## Activity 4 – Interesting shares to invest
The application ‘MACROX’ provides outstanding visual elements. In the tab ‘REGION’ and ‘countries and regions in Universe’ choose Europe; then go to the tab ‘SECTOR’ and select ‘Internet and Catalog Retail’; afterwards, click on the tab ‘SECURITY’ and sort the companies by ‘COMPANY MARKET CAP (USD)’. Browse for some attractive shares to invest in.

## Activity 5 – Are we going to get negative interest rates in the UK? I thought so one year ago; however, after recent developments in the supply side, it would look more appropriate a hawkish stance. Are we going to get higher interest rates next year in the UK?
Review forecasts of Centrals Bank’s interest rates. Use the application Central Bank Poll ’CBP.’
‘US FED INTEREST’ provides more detailed information relevant to Central Banks.
