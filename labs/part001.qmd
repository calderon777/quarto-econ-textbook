- go to www.r-project.com

- click on 'CRAN mirror'

- choose one of the two UK mirrors - https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/ or https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/

- Click on 'Download R for Windows' or 'Download R for macOS'

- Click on 'install R for the first time

- Click on 'Download R-... for Windows', the current version is R-4..5.1. Or alternatively, download the executable file for macOS. 

- double-click the downloaded file, then click on 'Run', 'language:English', 'OK', and read and follow the instructions of installation until you click on 'Next' for installing and 'Finish'

Then proceed to Installing RStudio.

- Go to rstudio.com

- click on 'download'

- download the Free version, download RStudio for Windows or macOS

- Click on 'Next' if you agree and on 'Install' and 'Finish' to complete the process.



### Introduction to R

**Long Tutorial**

We would cover a brief introduction on this labs, students would like to cover a longer tutorial to get use to R quickly. Click on this link: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf


**Quick tutorial - RStudio Screen**

You need to have installed R and RStudio to continue with this lab. 

- Open Rstudio in your computer.

![On this picture, there are three panels 'the Console', 'The Environment', and 'The Plots, Help and Files' panel.](/images/image7a.png)

- Let's choose a better appeareance for our RStudio. Click on "Tools" and then "Global Options."

![Image 5](/images/image8.png)

- Afterwards, in the window "Options", click on "Appearance", RStudio theme: "Modern", Editor font: "Courier", Editor theme: Cobalt. Finally, click on "Apply"

![Image 6](/images/image9.png)

- Now, we want to open a file to save the code that we are learning during this session. Click on 'File', 'New File', and 'R Script'; or simply press Ctrl+Shift+N; this will open a new panel called 'Script' where we are going to write the commands for R. The name of the script is Untitled 1. At the end of this session save the script in a folder for this module.

![Image 7](/images/image10.png)

Let's learn how to write our own comments in our R code/ script. 

- On the script panel, type the caracter # and then write 'LAB ONE ‚Äì ECON2545 ‚Äì AND THE DATE TODAY'. 

R will ignore any line of command starting with #. You can use # to add comments, titles, reminders within your R code/ R Script.

![Image 8](/images/image11.png)

The Rstudio screen has four windows or panels: 1. Console. 2. Environment and history. 3. Files, plots, packages and help. 4. The R script(s) and data view. The R script is where you keep a record of your work or commands - in a line by line basis. For Stata users this would be like the do-file, for SPSS users is like the syntax and for SAS users the SAS program.

- Let's type 'getwd()' in line number '2' and hit the keys 'ctrl+enter' in your keyboard at the same time. If you did this correctly you will see in the console panel the folder or working directory that R is using to download and upload data.

![Image 9](/images/image12.png)

Let's create a folder in Windows for your course using File Explorer. I called my folder 'R code ‚Äì LABs'. Afterwards, in RStudio' go to 'Session', 'Set Working Directory', and 'Choose Directory', afterwards, select the folder 'R code ‚Äì LABs' or the name you used.

![Image 10](/images/image13.png)

The above will result in code within the 'Console', the code is setwd(and a path/directory to the folder in your computer). Copy and paste that in your R code; next time you will only need to hit 'ctrl+enter' to set the directory or folder where you are going to work in R.

![Image 11](/images/image14.png)

- Copy and paste the outcome of you console in your R code; next time you will only need to hit 'ctrl' and 'enter' to set working directory.

![Image 12](/images/image15.png)

- In line number 4, type 5*5 and hit 'ctrl' and 'enter', the console will show the code and the result, 25.

- Let's create a matrix; use the lines 5 and 6 in your script and hit 'ctrl' & 'enter' to line 5 and then 6.

![Image 13](/images/image16.png)

If you did it correctly, the outcome in the console will be as follows:

![Image 14](/images/image17.png)

- In the line 5, you asked R to create a matrix called 'A', with numbers from 1 to 8, with four rows and two columns.

Have a look at the 'Environment' panel, you can see in there all active objects(e.g. matrix A), and the panel 'History' shows a list of commands used do far.

![Image 15](/images/image18.png)

- To see the matrix A in a new window, type the command View(A) in line 7 and hit the keys 'ctrl+ enter' to run line 7. Afterwards, come back to your R script 'Untitled 1'.

![Image 16](/images/image19.png)

**Packages tab**

The package tab shows the list of add-ons included in the installation of RStudio. If checked, the package is loaded into R, if not, any command related to that package won't work, you will need select it. You can also install other add-ons by clicking on the 'Install Packages' icon.

Another way to install add-ons is to type the command install.packages("name of the package"), and then you will be able to open the library of commands of that package.

- In line 8, to install the package forecast, type install.packages(‚Äúforecast‚Äù) and hit ctrl+enter. In the next window, you can hit yes to restart RStudio. See the picture below, you shall not get errors in the console, and at the end, the sign '>' will let you know the instalation run OK.

![Image 17](/images/image20.png)

### You must activate the package by typing, for example, library(forecast). This will automatically check the 'forecast' package.

![Image 18](/images/image25.jpg)

![Image 19](/images/image26.jpg)

### We will use the package forecast in this course to analyse and predict economic time series.

### Do not forget to save your R script in your own course folder! Use the icon to save, I called my file "lab001" and now is available , folder 'R code ‚Äì LABs'

### Script/Data View Window:
Begin scripts with a comment for title and description using the hash character (#). Anything after the hash on the same line is considered a comment and is ignored by R.
Code can continue to the next line without a special character, but only if the previous line ends in a way that suggests continuation (e.g., a comma or unclosed brackets).
To run a line of code, position the cursor on the line and press Ctrl+Enter. For multiple lines, select them and press Ctrl+Enter.

### Console/Output Window:
It's recommended to work in script mode for reusability.
Commands outside the script context can be typed at the bottom of the console, indicated by the ">" sign.
Press Enter to execute a command.
Use the up and down arrows to revisit and edit older lines of code previously typed into the console.

### Creating Graphs in R
R provides a suite of functions to create and customize graphs. Here's a brief overview:

### Basic Plotting:
Function: plot()
Usage: To plot data points and lines.
Arguments:
x, y: Variables to be plotted.
xlab, ylab: Labels for x and y-axis.
type: Determines the style of the plot. Options include:
"p": Points only
"l": Lines only
"b": Both points and lines
"n": No plot, creates an empty graph. Useful as a foundation for other plot elements.


### Plotting Mathematical Curves:
Function: curve()
Usage: To plot a curve based on a mathematical function over a specified range.
Example:
Key Argument:
‚Äúadd‚Äù: If set to TRUE, the curve is added to an existing graph.

```{r}
curve(x^1, from=-2, to=2, xlab="x", ylab="y = x" ) # Add another curve to the existing graph:*
curve(x^2, add = TRUE) #plot(1:100, type='n')*
curve(sqrt(x), from=0, to=100, xlab="x", ylab="y")
```

### Adding Lines:
Function: abline()
Usage: To add lines defined by specific parameters to a graph.
Arguments:
a, b: Defines a line based on its intercept (a) and slope (b).
h: Specifies the y-value for drawing a horizontal line.
v: the x-value for drawing a vertical line. *x*-value for a vertical line; coef, the name of a simple linear regression object, which includes the intercept and slope of a regression line.

```{r}
plot(1:10, type="n") # creates an empty graph
abline(a=8, b=-0.5, h=3.5, v=4) # Add straight lines to graph 
curve(x^2, from=0, to=20) 
abline(v=10)
```

### Debugging R Scripts with ChatGPT

## Step 1: Identify the Problem
If the code doesn't work as expected, identify the error message or the unexpected output. For example:
Error messages in the console.
Results that don‚Äôt match your expectations.
You run the script, but you receive an error: Error in mean(height): object 'height' not found.

## Step 2: Ask ChatGPT for Help
Describe the problem to ChatGPT. Be specific about the error or the issue. For example:
"I received an error message that says 'object not found'. What does this mean?"
"The histogram is not displaying any data. Can you help me fix it?"
"I tried to calculate the mean of a vector, but I got an error saying 'object not found'. Here's my code..."

## Step 3: Implement the Suggested Solutions
ChatGPT will suggest solutions or ask further questions to clarify the issue. Follow the suggestions step by step, adjusting your code as needed.
ChatGPT might respond with: "It looks like there's a typo in your code. The object you're trying to calculate the mean for is 'heights', not 'height'."

## Step 4: Test the Adjusted Code
After implementing the changes, rerun your script. If issues persist, describe the new output to ChatGPT, and continue the debugging process.

### Best Practices for Using ChatGPT with R
Incremental Development: Write and test your code in small chunks to catch errors early.
Clear Communication: When asking for help, provide clear and detailed information about your code and the issues you're facing.
Understanding Over Copy-Pasting: Try to understand the code snippets provided rather than just copying and pasting them. This will improve your R programming skills over time.

## Conclusion
With the above steps, you can effectively use ChatGPT to write and debug simple R scripts. Remember, practice is key to becoming proficient in R, and using ChatGPT can accelerate your learning by providing instant assistance and feedback.

## Lab 5 ‚Äì Intro to Refinitiv
**Workshop ‚Äì Introduction to Refinitiv Eikon**
Adapted from Darren Sparkes and Tom Webster‚Äôs ACFI3307
Complete the following activities to set up your Refinitiv Workspace account and learn the software's features.
**Activity 1.**
As a registered student on the ECON2545 module you should have received an email from Refinitiv that gives you your user ID (should be your DMU email address) and a link for you to access Refinitiv workspace as in Figure 1 below (Fig. 1). If you do not seem to have received this email then please check your junk and/or spam folders. If you still think that you have not received the email then please contact me by email to let me know
Please be aware that ‚ÄòRefinitiv Workspace‚Äô is compatible with Google Chrome and Apple Safari. If you are on a Microsoft Windows computer please download Chrome to your device if you do not use it already. You may need to make it your default browser for the purposes of setting up Refinitiv Eikon after which you can reset back to your usual default browser, remembering that you will need to use Chrome whenever using Refinitv Eikon.

![Image 72](/images/image72.png)

As sown in Fig. 16, Refinitiv have a series of training videos for you to watch that will cover how to use the Refinitiv software. Most of these are only a couple of minutes long. The first time that you click on a video you will be asked to sign in with your **DMU EMAIL ADDRESS**.
The training videos will enhance your ability to use the software and will, therefore, **directly impact upon your ability to manage your ****presentation**** assignment**** and final examination**. However, I recommend that once you have signed in, you go to Activity 11 to view the videos as part of the user ‚ÄòCertification‚Äô process rather than doing them as a standalone exercise.
Fig. 16

![Image 73](/images/image73.png)

**Activity 11.**
Refinitiv also has a user ‚ÄòCertification‚Äô qualification. This can be accessed from the menu bar as shown in Fig.18.

The ‚ÄòCertification‚Äô screen, as shown in Fig.19, gives details on how to complete the certificate. In brief, to obtain certification status, you must complete training videos and e-learning modules and then pass a 60-minute test including 30 multiple-choice questions. You will need to select the Eikon Product Certification (Fig 19.) and this will take you to the required Learning Materials.
Students must begin to complete the Refinitiv Workspace certification during the lab. Not only will this help students for their assessment, but it will also **enhance ****their**** CV****s**** for presentation to potential employers**.
Fig.19
**Activity 12.**
Continue to work through the Refinitv Eikon training materials and explore the software as part of your self-study. The quicker you become familiar with using the software, the easier you will find our labs throughout the academic year.
**Activity 13.**

**Workshop ‚Äì ****Terminal Access**** to Bloomberg**
This is an OPTIONAL material; students can download the lab for Access to Bloomberg Terminals access in bb, folder ‚ÄòLABs‚Äô Handbook‚Äô. The lab can also be downloaded from the shared folder for  on .

## Lab 6 ‚Äì Refinitiv :News, forecasts, Macrox
Open the user manual on bb, module site, find the folder ‚ÄòLabs‚Äô. Students must cover pages 9 to 13; ‚ÄúSetting up Thomson Reuters Eikon‚Äù.

## Activity 1 ‚Äì Read the news for the UK.
In the search box, type ‚ÄòTOPNEWS‚Äô and also ‚ÄòTOPNWS‚Äô. Within ‚ÄòTOPNEWS‚Äô, discuss the news you are following with your colleagues and review‚Äô trending topics‚Äô. Explore further the labels of this app. Search ‚ÄòIFR Markets‚Äô  in google; what it is? Click under the label ‚ÄòMarkets‚Äô and click on IFR and review the ‚ÄòRefinitiv NEWSCASTS‚Äô for interesting international financing review briefings. Finally, create your own new Refinitiv Digest.

## Activity 2 ‚Äì Find upcoming forecasts for the upcoming and highly important US economic events for w/c 1 Nov.
Explore economic news from specific groups of markets or countries. Use the Economic Monitor by typing ‚ÄòEM‚Äô. Apply filters to perform this activity.

## Activity 3 ‚Äì Discuss with your peers: in what country would you invest your savings today?
Explore the Economics Application‚Äô EC‚Äô. Investors usually use this top-down approach to choose whether to invest in a specific market. In what country would you invest your savings?

## Activity 4 ‚Äì Interesting shares to invest
The application ‚ÄòMACROX‚Äô provides outstanding visual elements. In the tab ‚ÄòREGION‚Äô and ‚Äòcountries and regions in Universe‚Äô choose Europe; then go to the tab ‚ÄòSECTOR‚Äô and select ‚ÄòInternet and Catalog Retail‚Äô; afterwards, click on the tab ‚ÄòSECURITY‚Äô and sort the companies by ‚ÄòCOMPANY MARKET CAP (USD)‚Äô. Browse for some attractive shares to invest in.

## Activity 5 ‚Äì Are we going to get negative interest rates in the UK? I thought so one year ago; however, after recent developments in the supply side, it would look more appropriate a hawkish stance. Are we going to get higher interest rates next year in the UK?
Review forecasts of Centrals Bank‚Äôs interest rates. Use the application Central Bank Poll ‚ÄôCBP.‚Äô
‚ÄòUS FED INTEREST‚Äô provides more detailed information relevant to Central Banks.
