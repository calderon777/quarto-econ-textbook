Install R and RStudio on your laptops/gadgets\nRStudio is a wrapper for R; we are using RStudio because it makes looks R more organised and straightforward. Follow the following instructions:\n\ngo to www.r-project.com\nclick on ‚ÄòCRAN mirror‚Äô\nchoose one of the two UK mirrors - https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/ or https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/\nClick on ‚ÄòDownload R for Windows‚Äô or ‚ÄòDownload R for macOS‚Äô\nClick on ‚Äôinstall R for the first time\nClick on ‚ÄòDownload R-‚Ä¶ for Windows‚Äô, the current version is R-4..5.1. Or alternatively, download the executable file for macOS.\ndouble-click the downloaded file, then click on ‚ÄòRun‚Äô, ‚Äòlanguage:English‚Äô, ‚ÄòOK‚Äô, and read and follow the instructions of installation until you click on ‚ÄòNext‚Äô for installing and ‚ÄòFinish‚Äô\n\nThen proceed to Installing RStudio.\n\nGo to rstudio.com\nclick on ‚Äòdownload‚Äô\ndownload the Free version, download RStudio for Windows or macOS\nClick on ‚ÄòNext‚Äô if you agree and on ‚ÄòInstall‚Äô and ‚ÄòFinish‚Äô to complete the process.\n\n\n\nIntroduction to R\nLong Tutorial\nWe would cover a brief introduction on this labs, students would like to cover a longer tutorial to get use to R quickly. Click on this link: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf\nQuick tutorial - RStudio Screen\nYou need to have installed R and RStudio to continue with this lab.\n\nOpen Rstudio in your computer.\n\n\n\n\nOn this picture, there are three panels ‚Äòthe Console‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe Environment‚Äô, and ‚ÄòThe Plots, Help and Files‚Äô panel.\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs choose a better appeareance for our RStudio. Click on ‚ÄúTools‚Äù and then ‚ÄúGlobal Options.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nImage 5\n\n\n\nAfterwards, in the window ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù, click on ‚ÄúAppearance‚Äù, RStudio theme: ‚ÄúModern‚Äù, Editor font: ‚ÄúCourier‚Äù, Editor theme: Cobalt. Finally, click on ‚ÄúApply‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nImage 6\n\n\n\nNow, we want to open a file to save the code that we are learning during this session. Click on ‚ÄòFile‚Äô, ‚ÄòNew File‚Äô, and ‚ÄòR Script‚Äô; or simply press Ctrl+Shift+N; this will open a new panel called ‚ÄòScript‚Äô where we are going to write the commands for R. The name of the script is Untitled 1. At the end of this session save the script in a folder for this module.\n\n\n\n\nImage 7\n\n\nLet‚Äôs learn how to write our own comments in our R code/ script.\n\nOn the script panel, type the caracter # and then write ‚ÄòLAB ONE ‚Äì ECON2545 ‚Äì AND THE DATE TODAY‚Äô.\n\nR will ignore any line of command starting with #. You can use # to add comments, titles, reminders within your R code/ R Script.\n\n\n\nImage 8\n\n\nThe Rstudio screen has four windows or panels: 1. Console. 2. Environment and history. 3. Files, plots, packages and help. 4. The R script(s) and data view. The R script is where you keep a record of your work or commands - in a line by line basis. For Stata users this would be like the do-file, for SPSS users is like the syntax and for SAS users the SAS program.\n\nLet‚Äôs type ‚Äògetwd()‚Äô in line number ‚Äò2‚Äô and hit the keys ‚Äòctrl+enter‚Äô in your keyboard at the same time. If you did this correctly you will see in the console panel the folder or working directory that R is using to download and upload data.\n\n\n\n\nImage 9\n\n\nLet‚Äôs create a folder in Windows for your course using File Explorer. I called my folder ‚ÄòR code ‚Äì LABs‚Äô. Afterwards, in RStudio‚Äô go to ‚ÄòSession‚Äô, ‚ÄòSet Working Directory‚Äô, and ‚ÄòChoose Directory‚Äô, afterwards, select the folder ‚ÄòR code ‚Äì LABs‚Äô or the name you used.\n\n\n\nImage 10\n\n\nThe above will result in code within the ‚ÄòConsole‚Äô, the code is setwd(and a path/directory to the folder in your computer). Copy and paste that in your R code; next time you will only need to hit ‚Äòctrl+enter‚Äô to set the directory or folder where you are going to work in R.\n\n\n\nImage 11\n\n\n\nCopy and paste the outcome of you console in your R code; next time you will only need to hit ‚Äòctrl‚Äô and ‚Äòenter‚Äô to set working directory.\n\n\n\n\nImage 12\n\n\n\nIn line number 4, type 5*5 and hit ‚Äòctrl‚Äô and ‚Äòenter‚Äô, the console will show the code and the result, 25.\nLet‚Äôs create a matrix; use the lines 5 and 6 in your script and hit ‚Äòctrl‚Äô & ‚Äòenter‚Äô to line 5 and then 6.\n\n\n\n\nImage 13\n\n\nIf you did it correctly, the outcome in the console will be as follows:\n\n\n\nImage 14\n\n\n\nIn the line 5, you asked R to create a matrix called ‚ÄòA‚Äô, with numbers from 1 to 8, with four rows and two columns.\n\nHave a look at the ‚ÄòEnvironment‚Äô panel, you can see in there all active objects(e.g.¬†matrix A), and the panel ‚ÄòHistory‚Äô shows a list of commands used do far.\n\n\n\nImage 15\n\n\n\nTo see the matrix A in a new window, type the command View(A) in line 7 and hit the keys ‚Äòctrl+ enter‚Äô to run line 7. Afterwards, come back to your R script ‚ÄòUntitled 1‚Äô.\n\n\n\n\nImage 16\n\n\nPackages tab\nThe package tab shows the list of add-ons included in the installation of RStudio. If checked, the package is loaded into R, if not, any command related to that package won‚Äôt work, you will need select it. You can also install other add-ons by clicking on the ‚ÄòInstall Packages‚Äô icon.\nAnother way to install add-ons is to type the command install.packages(‚Äúname of the package‚Äù), and then you will be able to open the library of commands of that package.\n\nIn line 8, to install the package forecast, type install.packages(‚Äúforecast‚Äù) and hit ctrl+enter. In the next window, you can hit yes to restart RStudio. See the picture below, you shall not get errors in the console, and at the end, the sign ‚Äò&gt;‚Äô will let you know the instalation run OK.\n\n\n\n\nImage 17\n\n\n\n\nYou must activate the package by typing, for example, library(forecast). This will automatically check the ‚Äòforecast‚Äô package.\n\n\n\nImage 18\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 19\n\n\n\n\nWe will use the package forecast in this course to analyse and predict economic time series.\n\n\nDo not forget to save your R script in your own course folder! Use the icon to save, I called my file ‚Äúlab001‚Äù and now is available , folder ‚ÄòR code ‚Äì LABs‚Äô\n\n\n\nImage 20",

Here‚Äôs a brief overview:\n\n\nBasic Plotting:\nFunction: plot() Usage: To plot data points and lines. Arguments: x, y: Variables to be plotted. xlab, ylab: Labels for x and y-axis. type: Determines the style of the plot. Options include: ‚Äúp‚Äù: Points only ‚Äúl‚Äù: Lines only ‚Äúb‚Äù: Both points and lines ‚Äún‚Äù: No plot, creates an empty graph. Useful as a foundation for other plot elements.\n\n\nPlotting Mathematical Curves:\nFunction: curve() Usage: To plot a curve based on a mathematical function over a specified range. Example: Key Argument: ‚Äúadd‚Äù: If set to TRUE, the curve is added to an existing graph.\n\ncurve(x^1, from=-2, to=2, xlab=\"x\", ylab=\"y = x\" ) # Add another curve to the existing graph:*\ncurve(x^2, add = TRUE) #plot(1:100, type='n')*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncurve(sqrt(x), from=0, to=100, xlab=\"x\", ylab=\"y\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Lines:\nFunction: abline() Usage: To add lines defined by specific parameters to a graph. Arguments: a, b: Defines a line based on its intercept (a) and slope (b). h: Specifies the y-value for drawing a horizontal line. v: the x-value for drawing a vertical line. x-value for a vertical line; coef, the name of a simple linear regression object, which includes the intercept and slope of a regression line.\n\nplot(1:10, type=\"n\") # creates an empty graph\nabline(a=8, b=-0.5, h=3.5, v=4) # Add straight lines to graph \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncurve(x^2, from=0, to=20) \nabline(v=10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of using the function abline()",

As a registered student on the ECON2545 module you should have received an email from Refinitiv that gives you your user ID (should be your DMU email address) and a link for you to access Refinitiv workspace as in Figure 1 below (Fig. 1). If you do not seem to have received this email then please check your junk and/or spam folders. If you still think that you have not received the email then please contact me by email to let me know Please be aware that ‚ÄòRefinitiv Workspace‚Äô is compatible with Google Chrome and Apple Safari. If you are on a Microsoft Windows computer please download Chrome to your device if you do not use it already. You may need to make it your default browser for the purposes of setting up Refinitiv Eikon after which you can reset back to your usual default browser, remembering that you will need to use Chrome whenever using Refinitv Eikon.\n\n\n\nImage 48\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 49\n\n\n\nActivity 2. You will be taken to Chrome to set up a password to use with your ID as in Fig. 2 below.

Most of these are only a couple of minutes long. The first time that you click on a video you will be asked to sign in with your DMU EMAIL ADDRESS. The training videos will enhance your ability to use the software and will, therefore, directly impact upon your ability to manage your presentation** assignment**** and final examination**. However, I recommend that once you have signed in, you go to Activity 11 to view the videos as part of the user ‚ÄòCertification‚Äô process rather than doing them as a standalone exercise. Fig. 16\n\n\n\nImage 73\n\n\nActivity 11. Refinitiv also has a user ‚ÄòCertification‚Äô qualification. This can be accessed from the menu bar as shown in Fig.18.

In brief, to obtain certification status, you must complete training videos and e-learning modules and then pass a 60-minute test including 30 multiple-choice questions. You will need to select the Eikon Product Certification (Fig 19.) and this will take you to the required Learning Materials. Students must begin to complete the Refinitiv Workspace certification during the lab. Not only will this help students for their assessment, but it will also enhance their** CV****s**** for presentation to potential employers. Fig.19 Activity 12. Continue to work through the Refinitv Eikon training materials and explore the software as part of your self-study. The quicker you become familiar with using the software, the easier you will find our labs throughout the academic year.

Thus, the interpretation of a slope parameter has to take into account possible changes in other independent variables: a slope parameter, say Œ≤k, gives the change in the dependent variable, y, when the independent variable xk increases by one unit while all the other independent variables remain constant. Equation 5.1 gives the general form of a multiple regression model, where y, xk, and e are N √ó 1 vectors, N is the number of observations in the sample, and k = 1,‚Ä¶,K indicates the k-th independent variable. The notation used in Equation 5.1 implies that the first independent variable, x1, is an N √ó 1 vector of 1s.\ny = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2x2 + ‚Ä¶ + Œ≤KxK + e (5.1)\nTable 5.1: Summary statistics for dataset andy\nThe model assumptions remain the same, with the additional requirement that no independent variable is a linear combination of the others.\n5.2 Example: Big Andy‚Äôs Hamburger Sales\nThe andy dataset includes variables sales, which is monthly revenue to the company in $1000s, price, which is a price index of all products sold by Big Andy‚Äôs, and advert, the advertising expenditure in a given month, in $1000s. Summary statistics for the andy dataset is shown in Table 5.1. The basic andy model is presented in Equation 5.2.\nsales = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2price + Œ≤3advert + e (5.2)\nTable 5.2 shows that, for any given (but fixed) value of advertising expenditure, an increase in price by $1 decreases sales by $7908. On the other hand, for any given price, sales increase by $1863 when advertising expenditures increase by $1000.\neffprice &lt;- effect(‚Äúprice‚Äù, mod1)\nplot(effprice)\nsummary(effprice)\nTable 5.2: The basic multiple regression model\nFigure 5.1: The partial effect of price in the basic andy regression",

The simplest possible call of this function requires, as arguments, the name of the term for which we wish the partial effect (in our example price), and the object (model) in question.

I chose to insert the I(advertÀÜ2) term to indicate that the variable of interest needs to be specified exactly as it appears in the model.\nAll the methods available in R for simple linear regression models are available for multiple models as well. Thus, to extract the information generated by the lm() function, we use the similar code as before. As we have already learned, the command ?mod1 gives a list with all the information stored in the mod1 object. The next code sequence illustrates how to access various regression output items for the basic andy equation.\nFigure 5.3: An example of using the function ‚Äôeffect‚Äô in a quadratic model\nThe covariance matrix, or the variance-covariance matrix shown in Table 5.3 contains all the estimated variances and covariances of the regression coefficients. These are useful when testing hypotheses about individual coefficients or combinations of those.\nTable 5.3: The coefficient covariance matrix\n5.3 Interval Estimation in Multiple Regression\nInterval estimation is similar with the one we have studied in the simple regression model, except the number of degrees of freedom is now N ‚àí K, where K is the number of regression coefficients to be estimated. In the andy example, df = 72 and the variances and covariances of the estimates are given in the following code sequence.\nWith the calculated standard error of b2, se(b2) = 1.096, we can now determine a 95% confidence interval, as shown in the following code lines. The code also shows using the R function confint(model, parm, level) to check our results.\nalpha &lt;- 0.05\ntcr &lt;- qt(1-alpha/2, df)\nlowb2 &lt;- b2-tcr*seb2\nupb2 &lt;- b2+tcr*seb2\nlowb3 &lt;- b3-tcr*seb3\nupb3 &lt;- b3+tcr*seb3\nconfints &lt;- confint(mod1, parm=c(‚Äúprice‚Äù, ‚Äúadvert‚Äù), level=0.95)\nkable(data.frame(confints),caption=‚ÄúConfidence intervals for ‚Äòprice‚Äô and ‚Äòadvert‚Äô‚Äù, align=‚Äúc‚Äù, col.names=c(‚Äúlowb‚Äù, ‚Äúupb‚Äù), digits=4)\nFinding an interval estimate for a linear combination of the parameters is often needed. Suppose one is interested in determining an interval estimate for sales when the price decreases by 40 cents and the advertising expenditure increases by $800 (see Equation 5.3) in the andy basic equation.\nTable 5.4: Confidence intervals for ‚Äôprice‚Äô and ‚Äôadvert‚Äô\nŒª = 0Œ≤1 ‚àí 0.4Œ≤2 + 0.8Œ≤3 (5.3)\nThe calculated confidence interval is (3.471,5.836). Let us calculate the variance of a linear combination of regression parameters in a more general way to take advantage of R‚Äôs excellent capabilities of working with complex data structures such as lists, vectors, and matrices. This code sequence introduces a few new elements, such as matrix transposition and multiplication, as well as turning a list into a vector. The matrix multiplication operator in R is %*% and the transposition operator is t().\nLecture 2 - Hypothesis Testing in Multiple Regression\nThe process of testing hypotheses about a single parameter is similar to the one we‚Äôve seen in simple regression, the only difference consisting in the number of degrees of freedom. As an example, let us test the significance of Œ≤2 of the basic andy equation. The hypotheses are given in Equation 5.4.\nH0 : Œ≤2 = 0, HA : Œ≤2 ‚â† 0 (5.4)\nalpha &lt;- 0.05\ndf &lt;- mod1$df.residual\ntcr &lt;- qt(1-alpha/2, df)\nb2 &lt;- coef(mod1)[[‚Äúprice‚Äù]]\nseb2 &lt;- sqrt(vcov(mod1)[2,2])\nt &lt;- b2/seb2\nThe calculated t is equal to ‚àí7.215, which is less than ‚àítcr = ‚àí1.993, indicating that the null hypothesis is rejected and that Œ≤2 is significantly different from zero.\nAs usual, we can perform the same test using the p-value instead of tcr.\nt &lt;- b2/seb2\npval &lt;- 2*(1-pt(abs(t), df)) #two-tail test\nThe calculated p-value is 4.423999 √ó 10‚àí10. Since this is less than Œ± we reject, again, the null hypothesis H0 : Œ≤2 = 0. Let us do the same for Œ≤3:\nalpha &lt;- 0.05\ndf &lt;- mod1$df.residual\ntcr &lt;- qt(1-alpha/2, df)\nb3 &lt;- coef(mod1)[[3]]\nseb3 &lt;- sqrt(vcov(mod1)[3,3])\ntval &lt;- b3/seb3\nCalculated t = 2.726, and tcr = 1.993. Since t &gt; tcr we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between advert and sales. The same result can be obtained using the p-value method:\npval &lt;- 2*(1-pt(abs(tval), df))\nResult: p-value = 0.008038 &lt; Œ±. R shows the two-tail t and p values for coefficients in regression output (see Table 5.2).\nA one-tail hypothesis testing can give us information about price elasitcity of demand in the basic andy equation in Table 5.2. Let us test the hypothesis described in Equation 5.5 at a 5% significance level. The calculated value of t is the same, but tcr corresponds now not to but to Œ±.\nH0 : Œ≤2 ‚â• 0, HA : Œ≤2 &lt; 0 (5.5)\nThe results t = ‚àí7.215, tcr = ‚àí1.666 show that the calculated t falls in the (left-tail) rejection region. The p-value, which is equal to 2.211999 √ó 10‚àí10, is less than Œ±, also rejects the null hypothesis.\nHere is how the p-values should be calculated, depending on the type of test:\nTwo-tail test (HA : Œ≤2 6= 0), p-value &lt;- 2*(1-pt(abs(t), df))\nLeft-tail test (HA : Œ≤2 &lt; 0), p-value &lt;- pt(t, df)\nRight-tail test (HA : Œ≤2 &gt; 0), p-value &lt;- 1-pt(t, df)\nAnother example of a one-tail hypothesis testing is to test whether an increase of $1 in advertising expenditure increases revenue by more than $1. In the hypothesis testing language, we need to test the hypothesis presented in Equation 5.6.\nH0 : Œ≤3 ‚â§ 1, HA : Œ≤3 &gt; 1 (5.6)\ntval &lt;- (b3-1)/seb3\npval &lt;- 1-pt(tval,df)\nThe calculated p-value is 0.105408, which is greater than Œ±, showing that we cannot reject the null hypothesis H0 : Œ≤3 ‚â§ 1 at Œ± = 0.05. In other words, increasing advertising expenditure by $1 may or may not increase sales by more than $1.\nTesting hypotheses for linear combinations of coefficients resembles the interval estimation procedure. Suppose we wish to determine if lowering the price by 20 cents increases sales more than would an increase in advertising expenditure by $500. The hypothesis to test this conjecture is given in Equation 5.7.\nH0 : 0Œ≤1 ‚àí 0.2Œ≤2 ‚àí 0.5Œ≤3 ‚â§ 0, HA : 0Œ≤1 ‚àí 0.2Œ≤2 ‚àí 0.5Œ≤3 &gt; 0 (5.7)\nLet us practice the matrix form of testing this hypotesis. R functions having names that start with as. coerce a certain structure into another, such as a named list into a vector (names are removed and only numbers remain).\nThe answer is p-value= 0.054619, which barely fails to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, the conjecture that a decrease in price by 20 cents is more effective than an increase in advertising by $800 is not supported by the data.\nFor two-tail linear hypotheses, R has a built-in function, linearHypothesis(model, hypothesis), in the package car. This function tests hypotheses based not on t-statistics as we have done so far, but based on an F-statistic. However, the p-value criterion to reject or not the null hypothesis is the same: reject if p-value is less than Œ±. Let us use this function to test the two-tail hypothesis similar to the one given in Equation 5.7. (Note that the linearHypothesis() function can test not only one hypothesis, but a set of simultaneous hypotheses.)\nhypothesis &lt;- ‚Äú-0.2price = 0.5advert‚Äù\ntest &lt;- linearHypothesis (mod1, hypothesis)\nFstat &lt;- test$F[2]\npval &lt;- 1-pf(Fstat, 1, df)\nThe calculated p-value is 0.109238, which shows that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. There are a few new elements, besides the use of the linearHypothesis function in this code sequence. First, the linearHypothesis() function creates an R object that contains several items, one of which is the F-statistic we are looking for. This object is shown in Table 5.5 and it is named test in our code. The code element test$F[2] extracts the F-statistic from the linearHypothesis() object.\nSecond, please note that the F-statistic has two ‚Äòdegrees of freedom‚Äô parameters, not only one as the t-statistic does. The first degree of freedom is equal to the number of simultaneous hypotheses to be tested (in our case only one); the second is the number of degrees of freedom in the model, df = N ‚àí K.\nLast, the function that calculates the p-value is pf(Fval, df1, df2), where Fval is the calculated value of the F-statistic, and df1 and df2 are the two degrees of freedom parameters of the F-statistic.\nkable(test, caption=‚ÄúThe linearHypothesis() object‚Äù)\nTable 5.5: The ‚ÄôlinearHypothesis()‚Äò object\nTable 5.6: The quadratic version of the andy model\n5.5 Polynomial Regression Models\nA polynomial multivariate regression model may include several independent variables at various powers. In such models, the partial (or marginal) effect of a regressor xk on the response y is determined by the partial derivative ‚àÇx‚àÇyk. Let us consider again the basic andy model with the added advert quadratic term as presented in Equation 5.8.\nsalesi = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2pricei + Œ≤3adverti + Œ≤4advert2i + ei (5.8)\nAs we have noticed before, the quadratic term is introduced into the model using the function I() to indicate the presence of a mathematical operator. Table 5.6 presents a summary of the regression output from the model described in Equation 5.8.\nLet us calculate the marginal effect of advert on sales for two levels of advert; the relevant partial derivative is the one in Equation 5.9.\n(5.9)\nadvlevels &lt;- c(0.5, 2)\nb3 &lt;- coef(mod2)[[3]]\nb4 &lt;- coef(mod2)[[4]]\nDsDa &lt;- b3+b4*advlevels\nThe calculated marginal effects for the two levels of advertising expenditure are, respectively, 10.767254 and 6.615309, which shows, as expected, diminishing returns to advertising at any given price.\nOften, marginal effects or other quantities are non-linear functions of the parameters of a regression model. The delta method allows calculating the variance of such quantities using a Taylor series approximation. This method is, howver, valid only in a vicinity of a point, as any mathematical object involving derivatives.\nSuppose we wish to test a hypothesis such as the one in Equation 5.10, where c is a constant.\nH0 : g(Œ≤1,Œ≤2) = c (5.10)\nThe delta method consists in estimating the variance of the function g(Œ≤1,Œ≤2) around some given data point, using the formula in Equation 5.11, where gi stands for calculated at the point Œ≤ = b.\nvar(g) = g12var(b1) + g22var(b2) + 2g1g2cov(b1,b2) (5.11)\nLet us apply this method to find a confidence interval for the optimal level of advertising in the andy quadratic equation, g, which is given by Equation 5.12.\n(5.12)\nEquation 5.13 shows the derivatives of function g.\n(5.13)\nThe point estimate of the optimal advertising level is 2.014, with its confidence interval (1.758, 2.271).\nVideo 1 - Interaction Terms in Linear Regression\nInteraction terms in a regression model combine two or more variables and model interdependences among the variables. In such models, the slope of one variable may depend on another variable. Partial effects are calculated as partial derivatives, similar to the polynomial equations we have already studied, considering the interaction term a a product of the variables involved.\nReal-world relationships are often not simply additive and can depend on multiple factors simultaneously.\nFor example, the effect of exercise on health might depend on one‚Äôs diet, illustrating that both factors together influence the outcome more intricately than separately.\nPotential pitfalls of ignoring interaction terms are biased estimates or overlooked relationships.\nThe data file pizza4 includes 40 observations on an individual‚Äôs age and his or her spending on pizza. It is natural to believe that there is some connection between a person‚Äôs age and her pizza purchases, but also that this effect may depend on the person‚Äôs income. Equation 5.14 combines age and income in an interaction term, while Equation 5.15 shows the marginal effect of age on the expected pizza purchases.\npizza = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2age + Œ≤3income + Œ≤4(age √ó income) + e (5.14)\n(5.15)\nLet us calculate the marginal effect of age on pizza for two levels of income, $25000 and $90000. There are two ways to introduce interaction terms in R; first, with a : (colon) symbol, when only the interaction term is created; second, with the * (star) symbol when all the terms involving the variables in the interaction term should be\npresent in the regression. For instance, the code x ‚àó z creates three terms: x, z, and x : z (this last one is x ‚Äòinteracted‚Äô with z, which is a peculiarity of the R system).\ndata(‚Äúpizza4‚Äù,package=‚ÄúPoEdata‚Äù)\nmod3 &lt;- lm(pizza~age*income, data=pizza4)\nsummary(mod3)",

The equation involves, besides the interaction term, logs of the response (dependent) variable is in logs and a quadratic term.\nlog(wage) = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2educ + Œ≤3exper + Œ≤4(educ √ó exper) + Œ≤5exper2 + e (5.16)\nTable 5.7: Wage equation with interaction and quadratic terms\nThe marginal effect of an extra year of experience is determined, again, by the partial derivative of log(wage) with respect to exper, as Equation 5.17 shows. Here, however, the marginal effect is easier expressed in percentage change, rather than in units of wage.\n(5.17)\nPlease note that the marginal effect of exper depends on both education and experience. Let us calculate this marginal effect for the average values of educ and exper.\nThe result of this calculation is %‚àÜwage = ‚àí1.698, which has, apparently, the wrong sign. What could be the cause? Let us look at a summary of the regression output and identify the terms (see Table 5.7).\nkable(smod4, caption=‚ÄúWage equation with interaction and quadratic terms‚Äù)\nThe output table shows that the order of the terms in the regression equation is not the same as in Equation 5.16, which is the effect of using the compact term educ‚àóexper in the R code. This places the proper interaction term, educ : exper in the last position of all terms containing any of the variables involved in the combined term educ‚àóexper. There are a few ways to solve this issue. One is to write the equation code in full, without the shortcut educ ‚àó exper; another is to use the names of the terms when retrieving the coefficients, such as b4 &lt;- coef(mod1)[[‚ÄúI(experÀÜ2)‚Äù]]; another to change the position of the terms in Equation 5.16 according to Table 5.7 and re-calculate the derivative in Equation 5.17. I am going to use the names of the variables, as they appear in Table 5.7, but I also change the names of the parameters to avoid confusion.\nTable 5.8: Anova table for the basic andy model\nThe new result indicates that the expected wage increases by 0.68829 percent when experience increases by one year, which, at least, has the ‚Äúright‚Äù sign.\n5.7 Goodness-of-Fit in Multiple Regression\nThe coefficient of determination, R2, has the same formula (Equation 5.18)and interpretation as in the case of the simple regression model.\n(5.18)\nAs we have already seen, the R function anova() provides a decomposition of the total sum of squares, showing by how much each predictor contributes to the reduction in the residual sum of squares. Let us look at the basic andy model described in Equation 5.2.\nTable 5.8 shows that price has the largest contribution to the reduction of variablity in the residuals; since total sum of squares is SST = 3115.482 (equal to the sum of column Sum.Sq in Table 5.8), the portion explained by price is 1219.091, the one explained by advert is 177.448, and the portion still remaining in the residuals is SSE = 1718.943. The portion of variability explained by regression is equal to the sum of the first two items in the Sum.Sq column of the anova table, those corresponding to price and advert: SSR = 1396.539.\nRStudio displays the values of all named variables in the Environment window (the NE panel of your screen). Please check, for instance, that R2 (named Rsq in the previous code sequence) is equal to 0.448.\nVideo 2 - Further Inference in Multiple Regression\nNew package: broom (Robinson 2016).\n6.1 Joint Hypotheses and the F-statistic\nA joint hypothesis is a set of relationships among regression parameters, relationships that need to be simultaneously true according to the null hypothesis. Joint hypotheses can be tested using the F-statistic that we have already met. Its formula is given by Equation 6.1. The F-statistic has an F distribution with the degrees of freedom J and N ‚àí K.\n(6.1)\nIn Equation 6.1 the subscript U stands for ‚Äúunrestricted,‚Äù that is, the initial regression equation; the ‚Äúrestricted‚Äù equation is a new equation, obtained from the initial one, with the relationships in the null hypothesis assumed to hold. For example, if the initial equation is Equation 6.2 and the null hypothesis is Equation 6.3, then the restricted equation is Equation 6.4.\nThe symbol J in the F formula (Equation 6.1) is the first (numerator) degrees of freedom of the F statistic and is equal to the number of simultaneous restrictions in the null hypothesis (Equation 6.3); the second (the denominator) degrees of freedom of the F-statistic is N ‚àíK, which is the usual degrees of freedom of the unrestricted regression model (Equation 6.2). The practical procedure to test a joint hypothesis like the one in Equation 6.3 is to estimate the two regressions (unrestricted and restricted) and to calculate the F-statistic.\n6.2 Testing Simultaneous Hypotheses\nLet‚Äôs look, again, at the quadratic form of the andy equation (Equation 6.5).\nsales = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2price + Œ≤3advert + Œ≤4advert2 + e (6.5)\nEquation 6.5 has two terms that involve the regressor advert, of which at least one needs to be significant for a relationship between advert and sales to be established. To test if such a relationship exists, we can formulate the following test:\nH0 : Œ≤3 = 0 AND Œ≤4 = 0; HA : Œ≤3 ‚â† 0 OR Œ≤4 ‚â† 0 (6.6)\nI have already mentioned that R can do an F test quite easily (remember the function linearHypothesis?), but for learning purposes let us calculate the F-statistic in steps. The next code sequence uses information in the anova-type object, which, remember, can be visualized simply by typing the name of the object in the RStudio‚Äôs Console window.\nalpha &lt;- 0.05\ndata(‚Äúandy‚Äù, package=‚ÄúPoEdata‚Äù)\nN &lt;- NROW(andy) #Number of observations in dataset\nK &lt;- 4 #Four Betas in the unrestricted model\nJ &lt;- 2 #Because Ho has two restrictions\nfcr &lt;- qf(1-alpha, J, N-K)\nmod1 &lt;- lm(sales~price+advert+I(advert^2), data=andy)\nanov &lt;- anova(mod1) anov # prints ‚Äòanova‚Äô table for the unrestricted model\nThe calculated F-statistic is fval = 8.441 and the critical value corresponding to a significance level Œ± = 0.05 is 3.126, which rejects the null hypothesis that both Œ≤3 and Œ≤4 are zero. The p-value of the test is p = 0.0005.\nUsing the linearHypothesis() function should produce the same result:\nHnull &lt;- c(‚Äúadvert=0‚Äù, ‚ÄúI(advert^2)=0‚Äù)\nlinearHypothesis(mod1,Hnull)\nThe table generated by the linearHypothesis() function shows the same values of the F-statistic and p-value that we have calculated before, as well as the residual sum of squares for the restricted and unrestricted models. Please note how I formulate the joint hypothesis as a vector of character values in which the names of the variables perfectly match those in the unrestricted model.\nTesting the overall significance of a model amounts to testing the joint hypothesis that all the slope coefficients are zero. R does automatically this test and the resulting F-statistic and p-value are reported in the regression output.\nsummary(mod1)",

However, one-tail tests, single or joint cannot be easily performed by an F test.\nLet us solve one more exercise involving a joint hypothesis with linear combinations of regression coefficients. Suppose we want to test the simultaneous hypotheses that the monthly advertising expenditure advert0 = $1900 in the quadratic andy model (Equation 6.5) satisfies the profit-maximizing condition Œ≤3 + 2Œ≤4advert0 = 1 , and that, when price = $6 and advert = $1900 sales revenue is $80000.\nTable 6.4 includes the F-statistic of the test, F = 5.741229 and its p-value p = 0.004885. Please be aware that the function tidy changes the names in the output of linearHypothesis. A useful exercise is to compare the raw output of linearHypothesis with the output generated by tidy(linearHypothesis(mod1)). There are several other possibilities to compare two regression models, such as a restricted and unrestricted ones in R, such as the anova() function or Wald tests.\nThese are going to be mentioned in later chapters.\nLab 1 - Omitted Variable Bias\nConsider the general model with two regressors in Equation 6.7, a model that I will call the true model.\ny = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2x2 + Œ≤3x3 + e (6.7)\nSuppose we are only interested in estimating Œ≤2, but there is no data available for x3, or for other reasons x3 is omitted from the model in Equation 6.7. What is the error in the estimate of Œ≤2 introduced by omitting x3? Equation 6.8 shows what is left of the true model after omitting x3.\nTable 6.5: The correct model\ny = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2x2 + u (6.8)\nLet b‚àó2 be the estimate of Œ≤2 when x3 is omitted. Equation 6.9 gives the bias in this simple, two-regressor case. The formula shows that bias depends on the direct relationship between the omitted regressor and response through Œ≤3, as well as the correlation between the omitted and the included regressors. When Œ≤3 and cov(x2, x3) are both positive or both negative the bias is positive (the incorrect model overestimates the true Œ≤2), and when they are of opposite signs the bias is negative (Œ≤2 is underestimated)\n(6.9)\nThe example in this section uses the dataset edu_inc, and two models: one where the response variable family income (faminc) is explained by the regressors husband‚Äôs education (he) and wife‚Äôs education (we), and another model, where the we regressor is omitted. The purpose is to compare the estimates coming from the two models and see if there is a significant difference between them.\ndata(‚Äúedu_inc‚Äù, package=‚ÄúPoEdata‚Äù)\nmod1 &lt;- lm(faminc~he+we, data=edu_inc)\nmod2 &lt;- lm(faminc~he, data=edu_inc)\nkable(tidy(mod1), caption=‚ÄúThe correct model‚Äù)\nkable(tidy(mod2), caption=‚ÄúThe incorrect model (‚Äòwe‚Äô omitted)‚Äù)\nThe marginal effect of husband‚Äôs education is much lower in the incorrect model. Let us apply the logic of Equation 6.9 to the edu_inc model. The direct effect of the omitted regressor (we) on response (faminc) is likely to be positive in theory (higher education generates higher income); the correlation between husband‚Äôs and wife‚Äôs education is also likely to be positive if we believe that people generally marry persons within their entourage. Thus, we should expect that omitting the regressor we should produce an overestimated marginal effect of he. Our data happen to confirm this supposition, though there is some chance that they might not.\nTable 6.6: The incorrect model (‚Äôwe‚Äô omitted)\nTable 6.7: Correct ‚Äôfaminc‚Äô model\nUnderstanding the problem of omitted variable is very important because it can justify the choice of a particular model. If one is not interested in the effect of variable x3 on y and can convince that x3 is uncorrelated with x2, one can argue with criticism about omitting the important regressor x3.\n6.4 Irrelevant Variables\nWe have seen the effect of omitting a relevant regressor (the effect is biased estimates and lower variances of the included regressors). But what happens if irrelevant variables are incorrectly included? Not surprisingly, this increases the variances (lowers the precision) of the other variables in the model. The next example uses the same (edu_inc) dataset as above, but includes two artificially generated variables, xtra_x5 and xtra_x6 that are correlated with he and we but, obviously, have no role in determining y. Let us compare two models, of which one includes these irrelevant variables.\nmod3 &lt;- lm(faminc~he+we+kl6, data=edu_inc) mod4 &lt;- lm(faminc~he+we+kl6+xtra_x5+xtra_x6, data=edu_inc) kable(tidy(mod3), caption=‚ÄúCorrect ‚Äòfaminc‚Äô model‚Äù)\nkable(tidy(mod4),\ncaption=‚ÄúIncorrect ‚Äòfaminc‚Äô with irrelevant variables‚Äù)\nTable 6.8: Incorrect ‚Äôfaminc‚Äô with irrelevant variables\nA comparison of the two models shown in Tables 6.7 and 6.8 indicates that the inclusion of the two irrelevant variables has increased the marginal effects, standard errors, and the p-values of he and we. Thus, including irrelevant variables may incorrectly diminish the significance of the ‚Äútrue‚Äù regressors.\n6.5 Model Selection Criteria\nThe main tools of building a model should be economic theory, sound reasoning based on economic principles, and making sure that the model satisfies the Gauss-Markov assumptions. One should also consider the possibility of omitted variable bias and the exclusion of irrelevant variables that may increase variablility in the estimates. After all these aspects have been considered and a model established, there are a few quantities that help comparing different models. These are R2, adjusted R2 (R¬Ø2), the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and the Schwarz (or Bayesian information) criterion (SC or BIC).\nWe have already seen how to calculate the coefficient of determination, R2 and how it measures the distance between the regression line and the observation points. A major disadvantage of R2 is that it increases every time a new regressor is included in the model, whether the regressor is relevant or not. The idea of counterbalancing this property of R2 has lead to a new measure, adjusted R2, denoted by R¬Ø2, given by Equation 6.10.\n(6.10)\nAdjusted R2, while addressing the problem with R2, introduces other problems. In general, no single goodness of fit measure is perfect. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Schwarz criterion use the same idea of penalizing the introduction of extra regressors. Their formulas are given in Equations 6.11 and 6.12.\n(6.11)\n(6.12)\nAmong several models, the best fit is the one that maximizes R2 or R¬Ø2. On the contrary, the best model must minimize AIC or BIC. Some computer packages, R included, calculate AIC and BIC differently than Equations 6.11 and 6.12 indicate. However, the ranking of the various models is the same.\nThe following code sequence needs some explanation. Function as.numeric extracts only the numbers from an object such as glance(mod1), which also contains row and column names. The purpose is to put together a table with information comming from several models. Function rbind gathers several rows in a matrix, which then is made into a data.frame and given the name tab. The part of code [,c(1,2,8,9)] at the end of rbind instructs R to pick all rows, but only columns 1, 2, 8, and 9 from the glance table. Function row.names assigns or changes the row names in a data frame; finally, kable, which we have already encountered several times, prints the table, assigns column names, and gives a caption to the table. While there are many ways to create a table in R, I use kable from package knitr because it allows me to cross-reference tables within this book. kable only works with data frames.\nTable 6.9 shows the four model selection criteria for four different models based on the edu_inc dataset, with the first column showing the variables included in each model. It is noticeable that three of the criteria indicate the third model as the best fit, while one, namely R2 prefers the model that includes the irrelevant variables xtra_x5 and xtra_x6.\nTable 6.9: Model comparison, ‚Äôfaminc‚Äô\nAs a side note, a quick way of extracting the information criteria from an lm() object is illustrated in the following code fragment.\nlibrary(stats)\nsmod1 &lt;- summary(mod1)\nRsq &lt;- smod1$r.squared\nAdjRsq &lt;- smod1$adj.r.squared\naic &lt;- AIC(mod1)\nbic &lt;- BIC(mod1)\nc(Rsq, AdjRsq, aic, bic)",

This method automatically adds higher-order polynomial terms to your model and tests the joint hypothesis that their coefficients are all zero. Thus, the null hypothesis of the test is H0: ‚ÄúNo higher-order polynomial terms are necessary‚Äù; if we reject the null hypothesis we need to consider including such terms.\nThe R function that performs a RESET test is resettest, which requires the following argumets: formula, the formula of the model to be tested or the name of an already calculated lm object; power, a set of integers indicating the powers of the polynomial terms to be included; type, which could be one of ‚Äúfitted‚Äù, ‚Äúregressor‚Äù, or ‚Äúprincomp‚Äù, indicating whether the aditional terms should be powers of the regressors, fitted values, or the first principal component of the regressor matrix; and, finally, data, which specifies the dataset to be used if a formula has been provided and not a model object.

In our case both p-values are slightly lower than 0.05, indicating that the model marginally fails the specification test and some higher order terms may be necessary.\nLab 2 - Collinearity\nThere is collinearity among regressors when two or more regressors move closely with each other or display little variability. A consequence of collinearity is large variance in the estimated parameters, which increases the chances of not finding them significantly different from zero. The estimates are, however, unbiased since\n(imperfect) collinearity does not technically violate the Gauss-Markov assumptions. Collinearity tends to show insignificant coefficients even when measures of goodnessof-fit such as R2 or overall significance (the F-statistic) may be quite large.\nLet us consider the example of the dataset cars, where mpg is miles per gallon, cyl is number of cylinders, eng is engine displacement in cubic inches, and wgt is the weight of the vehicle in pounds.\nThis naive model suggests a strong effect of the number of cylinders on fuel economy, but if we introduce more terms in the equation this result changes substantially.\nTable 6.11: Multivariate ‚Äômpg‚Äô model\nTable 6.12: Variance inflation factors for the ‚Äômpg‚Äô regression model\nmod2 &lt;- lm(mpg~cyl+eng+wgt, data=cars)\nkable(tidy(mod2), caption=‚ÄúMultivariate ‚Äòmpg‚Äô model‚Äù)\nIn the model summarized in Table 6.11 the number of cylinders becomes insignificant alltogether, a sharp change with respect to the previous specification. This high sensitivity of the estimates when other variables are introduced is also a sign of collinearity. Indeed, it is reasonable to believe that the characteristics of the vehicles vary together: heavier vehicles have more cylinders and bigger engines.\nA test that may be useful in detecting collinearity is to calculate the variance inflation factor, V IF, for each regressor. The rule of thumb is that a regressor produces collinearity if its V IF is greater than 10. Equation 6.13 shows the formula for the variance inflation factor, where Rk2 is the R2 from regressing the variable xk on all the remaining regressors.\n1\nV IFk = 1 ‚àí Rk2 (6.13)\nThe results in Table 6.12 show that the regressors cyl and eng fail the collinearity test, having V IFs greater than 10.\nTable 6.13: Forecasting in the quadratic ‚Äôandy‚Äô model\n6.7 Prediction and Forecasting\nWe have previously discussed the semantic difference between prediction and forecasting, with prediction meaning the estimation of an expected value of the response and forecasting meaning an estimate of a particular value of the response. We mentioned that, for the same vector of regressors, prediction has a narrower confidence interval than forecasting because forecasting includes, besides the uncertainty of the expected value of the response, the variablility of a particular observation about its mean. I essentially repeat the same procedure here for the quadratic andy model, which regresses sales on price, advert, and advert2. The key R function to calculate both predictions and forecasts is the function predict, with the following arguments: model, which is the name of a model object; newdata, which contains the new data points where prediction is desired; if newdata is missing, predictions are calculated for all observations in the dataset; interval, which can be ‚Äúnone‚Äù, ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù, or\n‚Äúprediction‚Äù, and tells R whether we want only a point estimate of the response, a prediction with its confidence interval, or a forecast with its confidence interval; level, which is the confidence level we want; if missing, level is 95%; other arguments (see ?predict() for more details).\nTable 6.13 displays the point estimate and forecast interval estimate for the data point price = $6 and advert = 1.9, which, remember, stands for advertising expenditure of $1900.\nUsing Indicator Variables\nThis chapter introduces the package lmtest (Hothorn et al.¬†2015).\n7.1 Factor Variables\nIndicator variables show the presence of a certain non-quantifiable attribute, such as whether an individual is male or female, or whether a house has a swimming pool. In R, an indicator variable is called factor, category, or ennumerated type and there is no distinction between binary (such as yes-no, or male-female) or multiple-category factors.\nFactors can be either numerical or character variables, ordered or not. R automatically creates dummy variables for each category within a factor variable and excludes a\n99\nTable 7.1: Summary for ‚Äôutown‚Äô dataset\n(baseline) category from a model. The choice of the baseline category, as well as which categories should be included can be changed using the function contrasts().\nThe following code fragment loads the utown data, declares the indicator variables utown, pool, and fplace as factors, and displays a summary statistics table (Table\n7.1). Please notice that the factor variables are represented in the summary table as count data, i.e., how many observations are in each category.\nlibrary(stargazer);\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndata(‚Äúutown‚Äù, package=‚ÄúPoEdata‚Äù)\nutown\\(utown &lt;- as.factor(utown\\)utown)\nutown\\(pool &lt;- as.factor(utown\\)pool)\nutown\\(fplace &lt;- as.factor(utown\\)fplace)\nkable(summary.data.frame(utown), caption=‚ÄúSummary for ‚Äòutown‚Äô dataset‚Äù)\nThis example uses the utown dataset, where prices are in thousands, sqft is the living area is hundreds of square feet, and utown marks houses located near university.\n7.2 Examples\nmod4 &lt;- lm(price~utown*sqft+age+pool+fplace, data=utown)\nkable(tidy(mod4), caption=‚ÄúThe ‚Äòhouse prices‚Äô model‚Äù)\nbsqft &lt;- 1000*coef(mod4)[[‚Äúsqft‚Äù]]\nbsqft1 &lt;- 1000*(coef(mod4)[[‚Äúsqft‚Äù]]+coef(mod4)[[‚Äúutown1:sqft‚Äù]])\nNotice how the model in the above code sequence has been specified: the term utown*sqft created three terms: utown, sqft, and the interaction term utown:sqft.\nTable 7.2 shows the estimated coefficients and their statistics; please notice how the factor variables have been market at the end of their names with 1 to show which\nTable 7.2: The ‚Äôhouse prices‚Äô model\ncategory they represent. For instance, utown1 is the equivalent of a dummy variable equal to 1 when utown is equal to 1. When a factor has n categories the regression output will show n ‚àí 1 dummies marked to identify each category.\nAccording to the results in Table 7.2, an extra hundred square feet increases the price by bsqft=$7612.18 if the house is not near university and by bsqft1 = $8911.58 if the house is near university. This example shows how interaction terms allow distinguishing the marginal effect of a continuous variable (sqft) for one category (utown=1) from the marginal effect of the same continuous variable within another category (utown=0).\nIn general, the marginal effect of a regressor on the response is, as we have seen before, the partial derivative of the response with respect to that regressor. For example, the marginal effect of sqft in the house prices model is as shown in Equation 7.1.\n[sqft] + utown √ó b[utown : sqft] (7.1)\nLet us look at another example, the wage equation using the dataset cps4_small.\ndata(‚Äúcps4_small‚Äù, package=‚ÄúPoEdata‚Äù)\nnames(cps4_small)",

Although usually it is useful to declare the categorical variables as factors, I will not do so this time. Let us consider the model in Equation 7.2.\nwage = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2educ + Œ¥1black + Œ¥2female + Œ≥(black √ó female) (7.2)\nTable 7.3: A wage-discrimination model\nWhat are the expected wages for different categories, according to Equation 7.2 and Table 7.3?\nwhite male: Œ≤1 + Œ≤2educ (the baseline category)\nblack male: Œ≤1 + Œ≤2educ + Œ¥1\nwhite female: Œ≤1 + Œ≤2educ + Œ¥2\nblack female: Œ≤1 + Œ≤2educ + Œ¥1 + Œ¥2 + Œ≥\nThese formulas help evaluating the differences in wage expectations between different categories. For instance, given the same education, the difference between black female and white male is Œ¥1 + Œ¥2 + Œ≥ = ‚àí5.11, which means that the average black female is paid less by $5.11 than the average white man.\nTo test the hypothesis that neither race nor gender affects wage is to test the joint hypothesis H0 : Œ¥1 = 0, Œ¥2 = 0, Œ≥ = 0 against the alterntive that at least one of these coefficients is different from zero. We have learned already how to perform an F-test the hard way and how to retrieve the quantities needed for the F-statistic (SSER, SSEU, J, and N ‚àí K). Let us this time use R‚Äôs linearHypothesis function.\nThe results in Table 7.4 indicates that the null hypothesis of no discrimination can be rejected.\nTable 7.4: Testing a joint hypothesis for the ‚Äôwage‚Äô equation\nLab 3 - Comparing Two Regressions: the Chow Test\nBy interacting a binary indicator variable with all the terms in a regression and testing that the new terms are insignificant we can determine if a certain category is significantly different than the other categories. Starting with the wage regression in Equation 7.2, let us include the indicator variable ‚Äúsouth‚Äù.\nThe table titled ‚ÄúModel comparison, ‚Äòwage‚Äô equation‚Äù presents the results of three equations: equation (1) is the full wage model with all terms interacted with variable south; equation (2) is the basic ‚Äòwage‚Äô model shown in Equation 7.2 with the sample restricted to non-south regions, and, finally, equation (3) is the same as (2) but with the sample restricted only to the south region. (This table is constructed with the function stargazer from the package by the same name (Hlavac 2015).)\nHowever, in R it is not necessary to split the data manually as I did in the above code sequence; instead, we just write two equations like mod5 and mod6 and ask R to do a Chow test to see if the two equations are statistically identical. The Chow test is performed in R by the function anova, with the results presented in Table 7.6, where the F statistic is equal to 0.320278 and the corresponding p-value of 0.900945.\nkable(anova(mod5, mod6), caption=‚ÄúChow test for the ‚Äòwage‚Äô equation‚Äù)\nTable 7.6 indicates that the null hypothesis that the equations are equivalent cannot be rejected. In other words, our test provides no evidence that wages in the south Table 7.5: region are statistically different from the rest of the regions.\nModel comparison, ‚Äôwage‚Äô equation\nwage\nTable 7.6: Chow test for the ‚Äôwage‚Äô equation\nIndicator Variables in Log-Linear Models\nAn indicator regressor is essentially no different from a continuous one and its interpretation is very similar to the one we have studied in the context of log-linear models. In a model like log(y) = Œ≤1+Œ≤2x+Œ¥D, where D is an indicator variable, the percentage difference between the two categories represented by D can be calculated in two ways, both using the coefficient Œ¥:\napproximate: %‚àÜy ‚àº= 100Œ¥\nexact: %‚àÜy = 100(eŒ¥ ‚àí 1)\nLet us calculate these two effets in a log-linear wage equation based on the dataset cps4_small.\ndata(‚Äúcps4_small‚Äù, package=‚ÄúPoEdata‚Äù) mod1 &lt;- lm(log(wage)~educ+female, data=cps4_small) approx &lt;- 100coef(mod1)[[‚Äúfemale‚Äù]] exact &lt;- 100(exp(coef(mod1)[[‚Äúfemale‚Äù]])-1)\nThe results indicate a percentage difference in expected wage between females and males as follows: %‚àÜwage = ‚àí24.32% (approximate), or %‚àÜwage = ‚àí21.59%\n(exact).\n7.5 The Linear Probability Model\nLinear probability models are regression models in which the response, rather than a regressor is a binary indicator variable. However, since the regressors can be either continuous or factor variables, the fitted values will be continuous. Equation 7.3, where y ‚àà {0,1} shows a general linear probability model.\ny = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2x2 + ‚Ä¶ + Œ≤kxk + e (7.3)\nHow can a continous fitted variable be interpreted when the actual response is binary? As it turns out, the fitted value represents the probability that the response takes the value 1, yÀÜ = Pr(y = 1). There are two major problems with this model. First, the model is heteroskedastic, with the variance being larger in the middle range of the fitted values; second, the fitted variable being continuous, it can take values, unlike a probability function, outside the interval [0,1].\nTable 7.7: Linear probability model, the ‚Äôcoke‚Äô example\nThe next example, based on the dataset coke estimates the probability that a customer chooses coke when coke or pepsi are displayed. Besides the two indicator variables disp_coke and disp_pepsi, the model includes the price ratio between coke and pepsi.\nFigure 7.1 plots the probalility of choosing coke with respect to the price ratio for the four possible combinations of the indicator variables disp_coke and disp_pepsi. In addition, the graph shows the observation points, all located at a height of either 0 or 1. In the legend, the first digit is 0 if coke is not displayed and 1 otherwise; the second digit does the same for pepsi. Thus, the highest probability of choosing coke for any given pratio happens when coke is displayed and pepsi is not (the line marked 10).\nFigure 7.1: Linear probability: the ‚Äôcoke‚Äô example\n7.6 Treatment Effects\nTreatment effects models aim at measuring the differences between a treatment group and a control group. The difference estimator is the simplest such a model and consists in constructing an indicator variable to distinguish between the two groups. Consider, for example, Equation 7.4, where di = 1 if observation i belongs to the treatment group and di = 0 otherwise.\nyi = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2di + ei (7.4)\nThus, the expected value of the response is Œ≤1 for the control group and Œ≤1 + Œ≤2 for the treatment group. Put otherwise, the coefficient on the dummy variable represents the difference between the treatment and the control group. Moreover, it turns out that b2, the estimator of Œ≤2 is equal to the difference between the sample averages of the two groups:\nb2 = ¬Øy1 ‚àí y¬Ø0 (7.5)\nThe dataset star contains information on students from kindergarten to the third grade and was built to identify the determinants of student performance. Let us use this dataset for an example of a difference estimator, as well as an example of selecting just part of the variables and observations in a dataset.\nThe next piece of code presents a few new elements, that are used to select only a set of all the variables in the dataset, then to split the dataset in two parts: one for small classes, and one for regular classes. Lets look at these elements in the order in which they appear in the code. The function attach(datasetname) allows subsequent use of variable names without specifying from which database they come. While in general doing this is not advisable, I used it to simplify the next lines of code, which lists the variables I want to extract and assigns them to variable vars. As soon as I am done with splitting my dataset, I detach() the dataset to avoid subsequent confusion.\nThe line starregular is the one that actually retrieves the wanted variables and observations from the dataset. In essence, it picks from the dataset star the lines for whichsmall==0 (see, no need for star$small as long as star is still attached).\nThe same about the variable starsmall. Another novelty in the following code fragment is the use of the R function stargazer() to vizualize a summary table instead of the usual function summary; stargazer shows a more familiar version of the summary statistics table.\nstargazer(starsmall, type=.stargazertype, header=FALSE, title=‚ÄúDataset ‚Äòstar‚Äô for small classes‚Äù)\nThe two tables titled ‚ÄúDataset‚Äôstar‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äù display summary statistics for a number of variables in dataset ‚Äòstar‚Äô. The difference in the means of totalscore is equal to\n13.740553, which should be equal to the coefficient of the dummy variable small in\nEquation 7.6. (Note: the results for this dataset seem to be slightly different from\nPoE4 because the datasets used are of different sizes.)\ntotalscore = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2small + e (7.6)\nTable 7.8: Dataset ‚Äôstar‚Äô for regular classes\nmod3 &lt;- lm(totalscore~small, data=star) b2 &lt;- coef(mod3)[[‚Äúsmall‚Äù]]\nThe difference estimated based on Equation 7.6 is b2 = 13.740553, which coincides with the difference in means we calculated above.\nIf the students were randomly assigned to small or regular classes and the number of observations is large there is no need for additional regressors (there is no omitted variable bias if other regressors are not correlated with the variable small). In some instances, however, including other regressors may improve the difference estimator. Here is a model that includes a ‚Äòteacher experience‚Äô variable and some school characteristics (the students were randomized within schools, but schools were not randomized).\nschool &lt;- as.factor(star$schid)#creates dummies for schools mod4 &lt;- lm(totalscore~small+tchexper, data=star) mod5 &lt;- lm(totalscore~small+tchexper+school, data=star)\nb2n &lt;- coef(mod4)[[‚Äúsmall‚Äù]] b2s &lt;- coef(mod5)[[‚Äúsmall‚Äù]] anova(mod4, mod5)\nBy the introduction of school fixed effects the difference estimate have increased from\n14.306725 to 15.320602. The anova() function, which tests the equivalence of the two regressions yields a very low p-value indicating that the difference between the two models is significant.\nI have mentioned already, in the context of collinearity that a way to check if there is a relationship between an independent variable and the others is to regress that variable on the others and check the overall significance of the regression. The same method allows checking if the assignments to the treated and control groups are random. If we regress small on the other regressors and the assignment was random we should find no significant relationship.\nmod6 &lt;- lm(small~boy+white_asian+tchexper+freelunch, data=star) kable(tidy(mod6),\ncaption=‚ÄúChecking random assignment in the ‚Äòstar‚Äô dataset‚Äù)\nfstat &lt;- glance(mod6)\\(statistic pf &lt;- glance(mod6)\\)p.value\nThe F-statistic of the model in Table 7.10 is F = 2.322664 and its corresponding p-value 0.054362, which shows that the model is overall insignificant at the 5% level\n7.7. THE DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES ESTIMATOR\nTable 7.10: Checking random assignment in the ‚Äôstar‚Äô dataset\nor lower. The coefficients of the independent variables are insignificant or extremely small (the coefficient on tchexper is statistically significant, but its marginal effect is a change in the probability that small = 1 of about 0.3 percent). Again, these results provide fair evidence that the students‚Äô assignment to small or regular classes was random.\nLab 4 -The Difference-in-Differences Estimator\nIn many economic problems, which do not benefit from the luxury of random samples, the selection into one of the two groups is by choice, thus introducing a selection bias. The difference estimator is biased to the extent to which selection bias is present, therefore it is inadequate when selection bias may be present. The more complex difference-in-differences estimator is more appropriate in such cases. While the simple difference estimator assumes that before the treatment all units are identical or, at least, that the assignment to the treatment and control group is random, the difference-in-differences estimator takes into account any initial heterogeneity between the two groups.\nThe two ‚Äòdifferences‚Äô in the diference-in-differences estimator are: (i) the difference in the means of the treatment and control groups in the response variable after the treatment, and (ii) the difference in the means of the treatment and control groups in the response variable before the treatment. The ‚Äòdifference‚Äô is between after and before.\nLet us denote four averages of the response, as follows:\ny¬ØT,A Treatment, After\ny¬ØC,A Control, After\ny¬ØT,B Treatment, Before\ny¬ØC,B Control, Before\nThe difference-in-differences estimator Œ¥ÀÜ is defined as in Equation 7.7.\nŒ¥ÀÜ = (¬ØyT,A ‚àí y¬ØC,A) ‚àí (¬ØyT,B ‚àí y¬ØC,B) (7.7)\nInstead of manually calculating the four means and their difference-in-differences, it is possible to estimate the difference-in-differences estimator and its statistical properties by running a regression that includes indicator variables for treatment and after and their interaction term. The advantage of a regression over simply using Equation 7.7 is that the regression allows taking into account other factors that might influence the treatment effect. The simplest difference-in-differences regression model is presented in Equation 7.8, where yit is the response for unit i in period t. In the typical difference-in-differences model there are only two periods, before and after.\nyit = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2T + Œ≤3A + Œ¥T √ó A + eit (7.8)\nWith a litle algebra it can be seen that the coefficinet Œ¥ on the interaction term in\nEquation 7.8 is exactly the difference-in-differences estimator defined in Equation\n7.7. The following example calculates this estimator for the dataset njmin3, where the response is fte, the full-time equivalent employment, d is the after dummy, with d = 1 for the after period and d = 0 for the before period, and nj is the dummy that marks the treatment group (nji = 1 if unit i is in New Jersey where the minimum wage law has been changed, and nji = 0 if unit i in Pennsylvania, where the minimum wage law has not changed). In other words, units (fast-food restaurants) located in New Jersey form the treatment group, and units located in Pennsylvania form the control group.",

R PRACTICUM\n7.9 R Practicum\n7.9.1 Extracting Various Information\nHere is a reminder on how to extract various results after fitting a linear model. The function names(lm.object) returns a list of the names of different items contained in the object. Suppose we run an lm() model and name it mod5. Then, mod5$name returns the item identified by the name. Like about everything in R, there are many ways to extract values from an lm() object. I will present three objects that contain about everything we will need. These are the lm() object itself, summary(lm()), and the function glance(lm()) in package broom. The next code shows the name lists for all three objects and a few examples of extracting various statistics.\nlibrary(broom)\nmod5 &lt;- mod5 &lt;- lm(wage~educ+black*female, data=cps4_small)\nsmod5 &lt;- summary(mod5)\ngmod5 &lt;- glance(mod5) #from package ‚Äòbroom‚Äô names(mod5)",

You have learnt how to forecast the future with Linear regression; now use the dataset for your assessment (presentation).\nVideo 2: Lab 17 Confusion Matrix, Melbourne rainfall forecast, what are odds of an event happening?\nThis week we covered during the lecture binary forecasts using logistic regression. This technique will help you to forecast binary events, e.g.¬†is your team going to win or not, is there going to be a recession again this year or not, is certain share going to increase greatly its price or not, etc. The basic idea is to forecast the probability of certain event happening. We will use 0 when the event occurs and 1 when it does not occur.\nActivity 1. Confusion Matrix\nTask1. The following table shows the typical outcome of a confusion matrix using R. Suppose a 2x2 table with the notation ‚ÄòReference‚Äô for your binary dependent variable (e.g.¬†recession or not recession), and the notation ‚ÄòPredicted‚Äô for your forecast. The confusion matrix shows how many times the estimated model perform well in the green sections of the table; contrary, the red sections are the number of mistakes of your prediction model/forecasts.\nRead the documentation about confusionatrix for R. Find and read the section ‚ÄòDetails‚Äô in the following link: . The link will explain the outcome of the confusion matrix in R.\nTask 2. Download in your appropriate datasets folder the file ‚ÄòMelbourneRainfall.xls‚Äô from the folder ‚ÄúData Sets‚Äù in bb. Afterwards, run the following code:",

    "text": "Understanding the Confusion Matrix\nA confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It summarizes the number of correct and incorrect predictions, comparing the actual values with the model‚Äôs predictions. It‚Äôs particularly useful for understanding the performance of a model in binary classification tasks.\nThe key terms in a confusion matrix are:\nTrue Positives (TP): Correctly predicted positive observations.\nTrue Negatives (TN): Correctly predicted negative observations.\nFalse Positives (FP): Incorrectly predicted positive observations (Type I error).\nFalse Negatives (FN): Incorrectly predicted negative observations (Type II error).\nKey Points to Discuss\nAccuracy: This is the proportion of total correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) out of all predictions. It‚Äôs a good measure when the classes are balanced but can be misleading when dealing with imbalanced classes.\nSensitivity (Recall): This indicates how well the model is at predicting positive class. High sensitivity means the model is good at catching positives but might also have more false positives.\nSpecificity: This is about identifying negatives. A high specificity means the model is good at avoiding false positives but might miss some positives (false negatives).\nPrecision (Positive Predictive Value): This tells you how many of the positive predictions were actually positive.\nNegative Predictive Value: This is about the proportion of negatives that were correctly identified.\nBalance Between Sensitivity and Specificity: Ideally, a model should have a good balance between sensitivity and specificity. However, depending on the application, you might prefer one over the other (e.g., in medical diagnostics, high sensitivity might be preferred).\nDifferences Between Training and Validation Results: It‚Äôs essential to compare the performance on the training set and the validation set to check for overfitting. If a model performs significantly better on the training set than on the validation set, it might be overfitted.\nLab 16: Neural Networks I\nCam Calderon\n2023-12-12\nNEURAL NETS",

In my youtube channel, I produced one example using European GDP; for future reference, you can review .\nACTIVITY ONE ‚Äì Retail Sales\nTask1. The retail sector is without doubts one of the most affected sectors during the pandemic; your first task is to read the latest report from ONS,\nTask 2. Go to the folder ‚ÄòR Code‚Äô in bb and download and open the file ‚ÄòModels with trend and seasonality. I wrote this R code for the excel file ‚ÄòONS retail.xls‚Äô, the excel file is available in the folder ‚ÄòData sets‚Äô in bb, you shall also download the excel file and place the file any folder such as ‚ÄòDocuments‚Äô; note we created a default working directory for econ2545 on a previous lab.\nRun the entire code and check line by line to understand what you are doing, if you have questions about any line in the code, ask your lecturer during the session.\nTask 2. The excel file Retails sales is outdated, and it would be fantastic to analyse the retail sales as this sector is very important for the UK economy. You must update the excel file using the ONS website or Refinitiv. Section 7, on the ONS link above, contains data for non seasonally adjusted retail sales, which could be better as we would like to forecast with seasonality.\nTask 3. Know that you know how to adapt the R code to new data, its time to use the dataset you will use for your first assessment (presentation 40%). Adapt the code and ask questions to your lecturer if needed.\nLab 15- Foreign Exchange Rate Market\nActivity 1. FX Top of Book\nTask 1. In the Eikon Toolbar, search .\nTask 2. Press the icon settings in order to add new profiles (groups of currencies) or different currencies into a group.\nActivity 2. Currency Performance/ Value Tracker\nUsing the Currency Performance/ Value Tracker application, users can compare how a specific currency performed historically and currently. While the 3 months implied volatility implies the market‚Äôs sentiments on the currency pair currently, the 3 months realised volatility is the traded volatility 3 months ago. Hence, comparing the two figures could be beneficial to an options buyer as to whether they should buy or sell an option right now.\nTask 1. In the Eikon Toolbar, search \nFor example, Here, the 3M implied volatility for USDCAD is 6.75 while the 3M realised volatility is 6.57. Hence the currency pair USDCAD is currently more volatile as compared to 3M ago.\nHave a look at the current volatiliries, what is the most volatile currency pair using both implied and realised volatility?\nACTIVITY 3. FX Polls / FX forecast\nTask1. Type FX Polls or FX Forecast in the application Search box located on the top left of your screen.\nYou can also access FX Polls by going to Refinitiv Icon next to the search box and Click &gt; Markets &gt; FX Overview Guide, and clicking the FX Polls link available in the MARKET TOOLS area.\nTask 2. Choose one of the forecast contributors and check the box ‚ÄòShow Historical Poll Data‚Äô. In your opinion, what is the best forecaster for EURUSD?\nActivity 4. Calculating GBPUSD autocorrelation\nTask 1. Get the time series in R.\n\nAPI\n#install.packages(‚Äúdevtools‚Äù)\nlibrary(devtools)\n#install_github(‚Äúahmedmohamedali/eikonapir‚Äù, force=TRUE)\nlibrary(eikonapir)\neikonapir::set_proxy_port(9000L)\neikonapir::set_app_id(‚Äòyour Refinitiv Key - APPKEY‚Äô)\ngbp &lt;- get_timeseries(‚ÄúGBP=‚Äù,\nstart_date = ‚Äú2013-01-01T01:00:00‚Äù,\nend_date= paste0(Sys.Date(), ‚ÄúT01:00:00‚Äù),\nraw_output = FALSE, interval = ‚Äúmonthly‚Äù)\nstr(gbp)\ngbp.n &lt;- as.numeric(gbp$‚ÄòCLOSE‚Äô)\ngbp.df &lt;-as.data.frame(gbp.n)\nView(gbp.df)\nTask 2.

Install R and RStudio on your laptops/gadgets\nRStudio is a wrapper for R; we are using RStudio because it makes looks R more organised and straightforward. Follow the following instructions:\n\ngo to www.r-project.com\nclick on ‚ÄòCRAN mirror‚Äô\nchoose one of the two UK mirrors - https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/ or https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/\nClick on ‚ÄòDownload R for Windows‚Äô or ‚ÄòDownload R for macOS‚Äô\nClick on ‚Äôinstall R for the first time\nClick on ‚ÄòDownload R-‚Ä¶ for Windows‚Äô, the current version is R-4..5.1. Or alternatively, download the executable file for macOS.\ndouble-click the downloaded file, then click on ‚ÄòRun‚Äô, ‚Äòlanguage:English‚Äô, ‚ÄòOK‚Äô, and read and follow the instructions of installation until you click on ‚ÄòNext‚Äô for installing and ‚ÄòFinish‚Äô\n\nThen proceed to Installing RStudio.\n\nGo to rstudio.com\nclick on ‚Äòdownload‚Äô\ndownload the Free version, download RStudio for Windows or macOS\nClick on ‚ÄòNext‚Äô if you agree and on ‚ÄòInstall‚Äô and ‚ÄòFinish‚Äô to complete the process.\n\n\n\nIntroduction to R\nLong Tutorial\nWe would cover a brief introduction on this labs, students would like to cover a longer tutorial to get use to R quickly. Click on this link: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf\nQuick tutorial - RStudio Screen\nYou need to have installed R and RStudio to continue with this lab.\n\nOpen Rstudio in your computer.\n\n\n\n\nOn this picture, there are three panels ‚Äòthe Console‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe Environment‚Äô, and ‚ÄòThe Plots, Help and Files‚Äô panel.\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs choose a better appeareance for our RStudio. Click on ‚ÄúTools‚Äù and then ‚ÄúGlobal Options.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nImage 5\n\n\n\nAfterwards, in the window ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù, click on ‚ÄúAppearance‚Äù, RStudio theme: ‚ÄúModern‚Äù, Editor font: ‚ÄúCourier‚Äù, Editor theme: Cobalt. Finally, click on ‚ÄúApply‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nImage 6\n\n\n\nNow, we want to open a file to save the code that we are learning during this session. Click on ‚ÄòFile‚Äô, ‚ÄòNew File‚Äô, and ‚ÄòR Script‚Äô; or simply press Ctrl+Shift+N; this will open a new panel called ‚ÄòScript‚Äô where we are going to write the commands for R. The name of the script is Untitled 1. At the end of this session save the script in a folder for this module.\n\n\n\n\nImage 7\n\n\nLet‚Äôs learn how to write our own comments in our R code/ script.\n\nOn the script panel, type the caracter # and then write ‚ÄòLAB ONE ‚Äì ECON2545 ‚Äì AND THE DATE TODAY‚Äô.\n\nR will ignore any line of command starting with #. You can use # to add comments, titles, reminders within your R code/ R Script.\n\n\n\nImage 8\n\n\nThe Rstudio screen has four windows or panels: 1. Console. 2. Environment and history. 3. Files, plots, packages and help. 4. The R script(s) and data view. The R script is where you keep a record of your work or commands - in a line by line basis. For Stata users this would be like the do-file, for SPSS users is like the syntax and for SAS users the SAS program.\n\nLet‚Äôs type ‚Äògetwd()‚Äô in line number ‚Äò2‚Äô and hit the keys ‚Äòctrl+enter‚Äô in your keyboard at the same time. If you did this correctly you will see in the console panel the folder or working directory that R is using to download and upload data.\n\n\n\n\nImage 9\n\n\nLet‚Äôs create a folder in Windows for your course using File Explorer. I called my folder ‚ÄòR code ‚Äì LABs‚Äô. Afterwards, in RStudio‚Äô go to ‚ÄòSession‚Äô, ‚ÄòSet Working Directory‚Äô, and ‚ÄòChoose Directory‚Äô, afterwards, select the folder ‚ÄòR code ‚Äì LABs‚Äô or the name you used.\n\n\n\nImage 10\n\n\nThe above will result in code within the ‚ÄòConsole‚Äô, the code is setwd(and a path/directory to the folder in your computer). Copy and paste that in your R code; next time you will only need to hit ‚Äòctrl+enter‚Äô to set the directory or folder where you are going to work in R.\n\n\n\nImage 11\n\n\n\nCopy and paste the outcome of you console in your R code; next time you will only need to hit ‚Äòctrl‚Äô and ‚Äòenter‚Äô to set working directory.\n\n\n\n\nImage 12\n\n\n\nIn line number 4, type 5*5 and hit ‚Äòctrl‚Äô and ‚Äòenter‚Äô, the console will show the code and the result, 25.\nLet‚Äôs create a matrix; use the lines 5 and 6 in your script and hit ‚Äòctrl‚Äô & ‚Äòenter‚Äô to line 5 and then 6.\n\n\n\n\nImage 13\n\n\nIf you did it correctly, the outcome in the console will be as follows:\n\n\n\nImage 14\n\n\n\nIn the line 5, you asked R to create a matrix called ‚ÄòA‚Äô, with numbers from 1 to 8, with four rows and two columns.\n\nHave a look at the ‚ÄòEnvironment‚Äô panel, you can see in there all active objects(e.g.¬†matrix A), and the panel ‚ÄòHistory‚Äô shows a list of commands used do far.\n\n\n\nImage 15\n\n\n\nTo see the matrix A in a new window, type the command View(A) in line 7 and hit the keys ‚Äòctrl+ enter‚Äô to run line 7. Afterwards, come back to your R script ‚ÄòUntitled 1‚Äô.\n\n\n\n\nImage 16\n\n\nPackages tab\nThe package tab shows the list of add-ons included in the installation of RStudio. If checked, the package is loaded into R, if not, any command related to that package won‚Äôt work, you will need select it. You can also install other add-ons by clicking on the ‚ÄòInstall Packages‚Äô icon.\nAnother way to install add-ons is to type the command install.packages(‚Äúname of the package‚Äù), and then you will be able to open the library of commands of that package.\n\nIn line 8, to install the package forecast, type install.packages(‚Äúforecast‚Äù) and hit ctrl+enter. In the next window, you can hit yes to restart RStudio. See the picture below, you shall not get errors in the console, and at the end, the sign ‚Äò&gt;‚Äô will let you know the instalation run OK.\n\n\n\n\nImage 17\n\n\n\n\nYou must activate the package by typing, for example, library(forecast). This will automatically check the ‚Äòforecast‚Äô package.\n\n\n\nImage 18\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 19\n\n\n\n\nWe will use the package forecast in this course to analyse and predict economic time series.\n\n\nDo not forget to save your R script in your own course folder! Use the icon to save, I called my file ‚Äúlab001‚Äù and now is available , folder ‚ÄòR code ‚Äì LABs‚Äô\n\n\n\nImage 20",

Options include: ‚Äúp‚Äù: Points only ‚Äúl‚Äù: Lines only ‚Äúb‚Äù: Both points and lines ‚Äún‚Äù: No plot, creates an empty graph. Useful as a foundation for other plot elements.\n\n\nPlotting Mathematical Curves:\nFunction: curve() Usage: To plot a curve based on a mathematical function over a specified range. Example: Key Argument: ‚Äúadd‚Äù: If set to TRUE, the curve is added to an existing graph.\n\ncurve(x^1, from=-2, to=2, xlab=\"x\", ylab=\"y = x\" ) # Add another curve to the existing graph:*\ncurve(x^2, add = TRUE) #plot(1:100, type='n')*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncurve(sqrt(x), from=0, to=100, xlab=\"x\", ylab=\"y\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Lines:\nFunction: abline() Usage: To add lines defined by specific parameters to a graph. Arguments: a, b: Defines a line based on its intercept (a) and slope (b). h: Specifies the y-value for drawing a horizontal line. v: the x-value for drawing a vertical line. x-value for a vertical line; coef, the name of a simple linear regression object, which includes the intercept and slope of a regression line.\n\nplot(1:10, type=\"n\") # creates an empty graph\nabline(a=8, b=-0.5, h=3.5, v=4) # Add straight lines to graph \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncurve(x^2, from=0, to=20) \nabline(v=10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of using the function abline()",

As a registered student on the ECON2545 module you should have received an email from Refinitiv that gives you your user ID (should be your DMU email address) and a link for you to access Refinitiv workspace as in Figure 1 below (Fig. 1). If you do not seem to have received this email then please check your junk and/or spam folders. If you still think that you have not received the email then please contact me by email to let me know Please be aware that ‚ÄòRefinitiv Workspace‚Äô is compatible with Google Chrome and Apple Safari. If you are on a Microsoft Windows computer please download Chrome to your device if you do not use it already. You may need to make it your default browser for the purposes of setting up Refinitiv Eikon after which you can reset back to your usual default browser, remembering that you will need to use Chrome whenever using Refinitv Eikon.\n\n\n\nImage 48\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 49\n\n\n\nActivity 2. You will be taken to Chrome to set up a password to use with your ID as in Fig. 2 below. Please ensure that you choose a password that you can remember and/or write it down somewhere (perhaps on your phone) so that you will be able to access Eikon in the future.\n\n\n\nImage 50\n\n\nActivity 3.\n\n\n\nImage 51\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 52\n\n\nActivity 4.\n\n\n\nImage 53\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 54\n\n\nActivity 5.\n\n\n\nImage 55\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 56\n\n\nFig. 6\n\n\n\nImage 57\n\n\nFig. 7\n\n\n\nImage 58\n\n\n\nActivity 6.\n\n\n\nImage 59\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 60\n\n\nFig. 9\n\n\n\nImage 61\n\n\n\nActivity 7. You should be presented with your home screen as in Fig. 10. If your screen does not look exactly the same as Fig. 10, there is no need to worry. You will have the chance to set your homescreen to what you want in the future. Fig. 10\n\n\n\nImage 62\n\n\nActivity 8.** **** ** Fig 11.\n\n\n\nImage 63\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 64\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 65\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 66\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 67\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 68\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 69\n\n\nFig. 14\n\n\n\nImage 70\n\n\nActivity 10.\n\n\n\nImage 71\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 72\n\n\nAs sown in Fig. 16, Refinitiv have a series of training videos for you to watch that will cover how to use the Refinitiv software. Most of these are only a couple of minutes long. The first time that you click on a video you will be asked to sign in with your DMU EMAIL ADDRESS. The training videos will enhance your ability to use the software and will, therefore, directly impact upon your ability to manage your presentation** assignment**** and final examination**. However, I recommend that once you have signed in, you go to Activity 11 to view the videos as part of the user ‚ÄòCertification‚Äô process rather than doing them as a standalone exercise. Fig. 16\n\n\n\nImage 73\n\n\nActivity 11. Refinitiv also has a user ‚ÄòCertification‚Äô qualification. This can be accessed from the menu bar as shown in Fig.18. Fig. 18\n\n\n\nImage 74\n\n\nFig. 19\n\n\n\nImage 75\n\n\nThe ‚ÄòCertification‚Äô screen, as shown in Fig.19, gives details on how to complete the certificate. In brief, to obtain certification status, you must complete training videos and e-learning modules and then pass a 60-minute test including 30 multiple-choice questions. You will need to select the Eikon Product Certification (Fig 19.) and this will take you to the required Learning Materials. Students must begin to complete the Refinitiv Workspace certification during the lab. Not only will this help students for their assessment, but it will also enhance their** CV****s**** for presentation to potential employers. Fig.19 Activity 12. Continue to work through the Refinitv Eikon training materials and explore the software as part of your self-study. The quicker you become familiar with using the software, the easier you will find our labs throughout the academic year. Activity 13.**\n\n\n\nImage 76\n\n\nWorkshop ‚Äì Terminal Access** to Bloomberg** This is an OPTIONAL material; students can download the lab for Access to Bloomberg Terminals access in bb, folder ‚ÄòLABs‚Äô Handbook‚Äô.

The focus includes a variety of estimation methods for economic data with diverse structures and uses applied applications of these econometric methods to estimate empirical models. These techniques provide a foundation for the final-year dissertation project.\nData Analytics provides an applied framework for economists to understand economic decision-making and the formation of expectations and forecasting. Analytics follows a topic-based approach to forecasting techniques and automatisation to areas of study such as Economics, Environmental Economics, Capital Markets, and Financial Economics. The content also covers an introduction to the Trading room, this will allow the techniques to be contextualised to applied problems.\nThis handbook has been produced to provide students with specific information and guidance about their labs. The contents of this handbook are indicative, this means they can be updated or modified upon the review of the module leader (Cam).\nAn electronic version of this handbook (which is continuously updated) is available on the VLE system, which you should consult regularly as the main reference point throughout your studies.\nThe handbook is organised in 50 minutes chunks, sometimes active lectures, othertimes practical labs.\n\n\nApp and Website Disclaimer\nFrom time to time this website may include links to other third party websites.

He says England may be in a position ‚Äúto begin the phased reopening of shops‚Äù and get primary pupils back to school in steps staggered by year groups ‚Äúat the earliest by 1 June‚Äù.\n1 June: Lockdown measures are eased, with school children in England in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 returning to the classroom.\n15 June: England‚Äôs retail parks, high streets and shopping centres welcome customers, while zoos and safari parks open their doors for the first time since March. Places of worship reopen for private prayer while some secondary school pupils have begun returning to their classrooms.\n16 June: The cheap steroid dexamethasone is hailed as a major breakthrough as a study suggests it is the first drug to reduce deaths from coronavirus.\n28 August: Those facilitating or organising illegal raves, unlicensed music events, or any other unlawful gathering of more than 30 people may now face a ¬£10,000 fine, as tougher measures come into force before the bank holiday weekend.\n11 September: The R value of coronavirus transmission across the UK rises above 1 for the first time since early March, according to government advisers, with the estimate between 1.0 and 1.2.\n18 September: Mr Johnson warns that a second wave of coronavirus has arrived in the UK. Sage estimates the R number - representing the number of people an infected person will pass the virus to - at between 1.1 and 1.4, meaning cases could rise very quickly.Parts of England‚Äôs North West, West Yorkshire and the Midlands face tough new restrictions in response to ‚Äúmajor increases‚Äù in cases.\n21 September: Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick tells a televised briefing the UK could see 50,000 cases a day by mid-October and a daily death toll of 200 or more a month later unless urgent action is taken.\n22 September: The prime minister announces new restrictions, including a 10pm curfew on pubs, bars and restaurants in England from 24 September, while face coverings are made mandatory in more scenarios and limits for weddings and receptions are cut to 15 people maximum. Scotland and Northern Ireland deviate from the restrictions in place for England by announcing bans on households mixing indoors, while Wales includes a ban on alcohol sales in off-licences and supermarkets after 10pm in addition to the curfew on hospitality venues.\n24 September: New regulations (SI 1029) come into force, in part, at 5 am in England, prohibiting certain ‚Ä≤restricted businesses‚Ä≤ and ‚Ä≤restricted services‚Ä≤ from carrying on that business or providing that service between the hours of 22:00 and 05:00. The regulations affect a wide range of establishments, including restaurants, bars, public houses, social clubs, casinos, bingo halls, bowling alleys, cinemas, theatres, concert halls, amusement arcades, funfairs (indoors or outdoors), theme parks and adventure parks. The protected area of Bolton is excluded from the scope of this legislation as additional restrictions apply\n27 September: The Labour Party urges the government to pause the return of university students as thousands self-isolate due to COVID-19 outbreaks, but the return is defended by Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who says clear guidelines are in place for universities. David Lammy, the Shadow Secretary of State for Justice, expresses concern that 10pm pub curfews have led to drinkers continuing to socialise afterwards, with them ‚Äúhanging around towns‚Äù and ‚Äúpotentially spreading the virus‚Äù.\n2 October: Around a quarter of the population of the United Kingdom, about 16.8 million people, are now in local lockdowns. This includes 23% of people in England, 76% of people in Wales and 32% of people in Scotland\n14 October: The new three-tier system of restrictions for England, taking effect from 14 October. Areas are grouped into one of three risk categories ‚Äì medium, high, or very high. Medium areas are subject to the rule of six and the 10pm curfew, high areas have restrictions on indoor meetings but groups of six can continue to meet in outdoor settings, and very high areas will see the closure of businesses such as pubs and casinos, but not restaurants. The Liverpool City Region is the only area to be placed in the very high category\n31 October: After scientists project that there could be several thousand COVID deaths a day, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announces a second lockdown for England, for four weeks from Thursday 5 November to Wednesday 2 December, in order to prevent what he describes as a ‚Äúmedical and moral disaster‚Äù for the NHS. England will then revert back to the tier system.\n\n\nWe add vertical lines with the command abline\nabline(v =4, col=‚Äúred‚Äù)\nabline(v =6, col=‚Äúblue‚Äù)\n\n\nthere are three events in June, we only use one vertical line\nabline(v =7, col=‚Äúblue‚Äù)\nabline(v =9, col=‚Äúred‚Äù)\nabline(v =10, col=‚Äúred‚Äù)\nWas covid a hoax?\nGoing forward, what timelines makes sense to make the partitions of the data to forecast?\nPerform a 12 months forecast using seasonal na√Øve forecast; what would be the beast ?\n\n\ninstall the package forecast if you have not done so previously.\ninstall.packages(‚Äúforecast‚Äù)\n#open the library forecast\nlibrary(forecast)\n\n\ncreate the object snaive.edeaths to keep in there the snaive estimation\n\n\nby visualisation I used a 10 months frequency in the waves on this data\n#h=6 as the excercise asks for a 6 monts forecast\nsnaive.edeaths &lt;- snaive(ts(edeaths$excess, frequency = 10), h=12)\nplot(snaive.edeaths)\nTo what extend the excess deaths decreased using the first wave of covid and the last fourth wave?\nExcess deaths decreased 83,17%\nWhat are the maximum deaths in the new calculation?\nAround 34,881 excess deaths.\nCreate two horizontal lines, one for zero (2015-19 average), and the second for the peak of the last death wave.\nIf excess deaths cross that threshold there might be a new lockdown?\nDo we anticipate a lockdown this Christmas?\nHow many excess deaths register the dataset in the first 12 months?\n325,624\nHow many casualties the model forecast in 12 months?

Choosing 12 months for the validation partition allows evaluating the prediction accuracy of 12-month ahead forecasts. A choice of a longer validation period might have been avoided to include recent data in the training period.\nWhat is the naive forecast for the validation period? (assume that you must provide forecasts for 12 months ahead)\nBecause there is seasonality in the series (waves), the na√Øve forecast for each of the months in the validation period is equal to an estimation of the duration of the wave, ceteris-paribus of other variables that can shorten or increase the length of the wave.\nCompute the RMSE and MAPE for the naive forecasts.\nRMSE =\nMAPE =\n\npartition of the data and forecast\n\n\n\nwe define the data as time series and generated our first time series graph\nedeaths.ts &lt;- ts(edeaths$excess, start = c(2019,12), end = c(2022, 10), freq = 12)\nplot(edeaths.ts, xlab = ‚ÄúDate‚Äù, ylab = ‚Äúweekly excess deaths per month‚Äù, main = ‚ÄúUK Excess Deaths‚Äù)\nstepsAhead &lt;- 9\nnTrain &lt;- length(edeaths.ts) - stepsAhead\ntrain.ts &lt;- window(edeaths.ts, start = c(2019, 12), end = c(2019,nTrain+12), freq=12)\nlines(train.ts, col=‚Äúblue‚Äù)\nvalid.ts &lt;- window(edeaths.ts, start = c(2019, nTrain + 13), end = c(2019, 12+nTrain + stepsAhead), freq=12)\nlines(valid.ts, col =‚Äúred‚Äù)\n\n\nThis is the command for the naive forecast, I am creating the variable ‚Äònaive4cast‚Äô, which is going\n\n\nto capture the results for the naive forecast in the training period.\nsnaive4cast&lt;-snaive(train.ts, h= 9)\n\n\nWe forecast using the training period\nforecast(snaive4cast, h=9)\n\n\nWe find level of accuracy, we will cover this during the next lecture\naccuracy(snaive4cast,valid.ts)\nplot(snaive4cast)\nlines(valid.ts)\n\n\nWe create a histogram of the residuals/errors/ random error\nhist(snaive4cast$residuals, ylab = ‚ÄúFrequency‚Äù, xlab = ‚ÄúForecast Error‚Äù, bty = ‚Äúl‚Äù, main = ‚Äú‚Äú)\nPlot a histogram of the forecast errors that result from the naive forecasts (for the validation period). Plot also a time plot for the naive forecasts and the actual sales numbers in the validation period. What can you say about the behavior of the naive forecasts?\nThe na√Øve forecasts are under-predictions of actual sales. This can be seen in both plots.\nThe analyst found a forecasting model that gives satisfactory performance on the validation set. What must she do to use the forecasting model for generating forecasts for year 2002?\nThe training and validation periods must be re-combined, and then the forecasting model should be applied to the complete series before producing future forecasts.

Information can typically be split into country, industry or company information. This information sheet does not cover all of the detailed information which you may need, but should act as a signpost for where to find the information you need.\nCOUNTRY-LEVEL INFORMATION\nECOW  provides economic information of a wide variety, over a number of years, such that changes can also be observed. Select the appropriate country, and depending on the source information for that country, up to 200 different data items may be available, including GDP, CPI, unemployment, housing market data, retail sector data, exports, imports and exchange rates\nCOUN  has 4 different tabs providing country information and charts, under the headings ‚Äòfinancial‚Äô, ‚Äòeconomic‚Äô, ‚Äòrisk‚Äô and ‚Äòprofile‚Äô which includes country officials and information about main exports for example.\nWEI  provides information about World Equity Indices and a snapshot of gains/losses in the indices.\nFFM to find case studies written by Bloomberg specialists.\nHit the key  on the function screen to access its instructions, definitions, documents and further information.\nActivity 3. Using Bloomberg From R and Excel\nBloomberg from R\nFirst, you need to be logged on to Bloomberg.\nIf the Bloomberg/Excel add-in does not work, then: 1. Close Excel and/or R 2. Keep Bloomberg running 3. Go to Start-&gt; Bloomberg -&gt; API Environment Diagnostics 4. Click Start when the Bloomberg API Diagnostics window has loaded 5. If a ‚ÄúLogin to wintrv‚Ä¶‚Äù message below then pops up, this occurs when Bloomberg isn‚Äôt open ‚Äì it is highly recommended that you have Bloomberg running; you can proceed without it, but you may not be able to resolve some errors if you do so 6. Once the check is finished, you will get a ‚ÄòDiagnostics completed‚Äô message 7. If the Repair button is available to press on the Bloomberg API Diagnostics window, it means it needs to run the repair and you should do so by clicking Repair (it should take a couple of minutes) 8. Once the check is done, and repair if necessary, the ideal state is all green ticks except for 2 yellow ‚Äú!‚Äù for Dotnet Installation and Excel Throttle Interval only.

The contents of this handbook are indicative, this means they can be updated or modified upon the review of the module leader (Cam).\nAn electronic version of this handbook (which is continuously updated) is available on the VLE system, Blackboard, which you should consult regularly as the main reference point throughout your studies.\nIndicative Contents\nPrerequisite 6\nLecture 1 - The Simple Linear Regression Model 7\nLecture 2 - Prediction with the Linear Regression Model 15\nVideo 1 - Using Indicator Variables in a Regression & Monte Carlo 23\nVideo 2 -Interval Estimation 28\nLab 1 ‚Äì Hypothesis Test, P-Value and Testing Linear Combination of Parameters 35\nLab 2 -The p-Value 40\nLab 3 - Prediction, R-squared, and Modelling 45\nLab 4 Linear-Log Models 52\nLab 5- Polynomial Models 59\nLab 6 ‚Äì Hands-on on your assignment 68\nPrerequisite\nReview the assignment brief for the report assessment and download an appropriate dataset.\nStudents will adapt the R scripts of the next three weeks of labs to the dataset and topic of the report.\nLecture 1 - The Simple Linear Regression Model\nNote: students must adapt the following R scrips to their assignment 2 (report) using an appropriate dataset.\nSummary: in simple linear regression, we use one independent variable to predict a dependent variable. The relationship is represented by a straight line with an intercept and a slope.\nIntroduction: In this lecture, we will explore the fundamentals of the Simple Linear Regression Model, a statistical method used to understand the relationship between two variables. This model is foundational for understanding more complex statistical analyses in your future studies.\nKey terms: A dependent variable, represented as ‚Äòy‚Äô, is what we aim to predict, while an independent variable, denoted as ‚Äòx‚Äô, is the variable(s) we use to explain y. Imagine predicting a student‚Äôs final grade (y) based on their hours of study (x). Here, the final grade depends on, or is predicted by, the hours of study.\nThe General Model\nThe model assumes a linear relationship between the conditional expectation of a dependent variable, y, and an independent variable, x. Independent variable sometimes are called ‚Äòresponse‚Äô or ‚Äòresponse variable‚Äô, and the independent variables ‚Äòregressors.‚Äô The assumed relationship has the form:\nyi = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2xi + ei, (1)\nwhere\ny is the dependent variable\nx is the independent variable\ne is an error term\nœÉ2 is the variance of the error term\nŒ≤1 is the intercept parameter or coefficient\nŒ≤2 is the slope parameter or coefficient\ni stands fot the i -th observation in the dataset, i = 1,2,‚Ä¶,N\nN is the number of observations in the dataset\nFigure: Example of several observations for any given x\nThe predicted, or estimated value of y given x is given by the following equation; in general, the hat symbol indicates an estimated or a predicted value.\nyÀÜ = b1 + b2x (2)\nThe model assumes that the values of x are previously chosen (therefore, they are non-random), that the variance of the error term, œÉ2, is the same for all values of x, and that there is no connection between one observation and another (no correlation between the error terms of two observations). In addition, it is assumed that the expected value of the error term for any value of x is zero.\nThe subscript i in Equation 1 indicates that the relationship applies to each of the N observations. Thus, there must be specific values of y, x, and e for each observation. However, since x is not random, there are, typically, several observations sharing the same x, as the scatter diagram in Figure above shows.\nExample: Food Expenditure versus Income\nThe data for this example is stored in the R package PoEdata (To check if the package PoEdata is installed, look in the Packages list.)\nlibrary(PoEdata)\ndata(food)\nhead(food)\nIt is always a good idea to visually inspect the data in a scatter diagram, which can be created using the function plot(). Figure 2.2 is a scatter diagram of food expenditure on income, suggesting that there is a positive relationship between income and food expenditure.\ndata(‚Äúfood‚Äù, package=‚ÄúPoEdata‚Äù)\nplot(food\\(income, food\\)food_exp, ylim=c(0, max(food\\(food_exp)), xlim=c(0, max(food\\)income)), xlab=‚Äúweekly income in $100‚Äù, ylab=‚Äúweekly food expenditure in $‚Äù, type = ‚Äúp‚Äù)\nEstimating a Linear Regression\nThe R function for estimating a linear regression model is lm(y~x, data) which, used just by itself does not show any output; It is useful to give the model a name, such as mod1, then show the results using summary(mod1). If you are interested in only some of the results of the regression, such as the estimated coefficients, you can retrieve them using specific functions, such as the function coef(). For the food expenditure data, the regression model will be\nfood_exp = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2income + e (3)\nwhere the subscript i has been omitted for simplicity.\nFigure: A scatter diagram for the food expenditure model\nlibrary(PoEdata)\nmod1 &lt;- lm(food_exp ~ income, data = food)\nb1 &lt;- coef(mod1)[[1]]\nb2 &lt;- coef(mod1)[[2]]\nsmod1 &lt;- summary(mod1)\nsmod1",

All we need to do is to plug the estimated parameter values and the given income into an equation like Equation (2). For example, the expected value of food_exp for an income of $2000 is calculated in Equation (4) below. (Remember to divide the income by 100, since the data for the variable income is in hundreds of dollars.)\n\n\n\nR does this calculations for us with its function called predict(). Extending the example to more than one income, say income = $2000, $2500, and $2700. The function predict() in\nR requires that the new values of the independent variables be organized under a particular form, called a data frame. In R, a set of numbers is held together using the structure c(). The following sequence shows this example.",

For instance, if the elasticity of price with respect to sqft is 0.5, a 1% increase in sqft leads to a 0.5% increase in price. if the elasticity is less than 1, it suggests that changes in sqft have a proportionally smaller effect on price, which might imply that other factors are also important in determining the price. unlike linear models, in non-linear models, elasticity can change at different levels of the independent variable.\nDraw a scatter diagram and see how the quadratic function fits the data. The next chunk of code provides two alternatives for constructing such a graph.

The procedure requires three elements: the hypotheses (the null and the alternative), a test statistic, which in the case of the simple linear regression parameters is the t-ratio, and a significance level, Œ±.\nSuppose we believe that there is a significant relationship between a household‚Äôs income and its expenditure on food, a conjecture which has led us to formulate the food expenditure model in the first place. Thus, we believe that Œ≤2, the (population) parameter, is different from zero. Equation 5 shows the null and alternative hypotheses for such a test.\n\n\n\nIn general, if a null hypothesis H0 : Œ≤k = c is true, the t statistic (the t-ratio) is given by Equation 6 and has a t distribution with N ‚àí 2 degrees of freedom.\n\n\n\nTest the hypothesis in Equation 5, which makes c = 0 in Equation 6.

The anova results in Table 4.1 include other useful information: the number of degrees of freedom, anov[2,1] and the estimated variance œÉÀÜ 2 =anov[2,3].\nLab 4 Linear-Log Models\nNon-linear functional forms of regression models are useful when the relationship between two variables seems to be more complex than the linear one. One can decide to use a non-linear functional form based on a mathematical model, reasoning, or simply inspecting a scatter plot of the data. In the food expenditure model, for example, it is reasonable to believe that the amount spent on food increases faster at lower incomes than at higher incomes. In other words, it increases at a decreasing rate, which makes the regression curve flatten out at higher incomes.\nWhat function could one use to model such a relationship? The logarithmic function fits this profile and, as it turns out, it is relatively easy to interpret, which makes it very popular in econometric models. The general form of a linear-log econometric model is provided in Equation 4.7.\nyi = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2log(xi) + ei (4.7)\nThe marginal effect of a change in x on y is the slope of the regression curve and is given by Equation 4.8; unlike in the linear form, it depends on x and it is, therefore, only valid for small changes in x.\ndy Œ≤2\n= (4.8) dx x\nRelated to the linear-log model, another measure of interest in economics is the semi-elasticity of y with respect to x, which is given by Equation 4.9. Semi-elasticity suggests that a change in x of 1% changes y by Œ≤2/100 units of y. Since semi-elasticity also changes when x changes, it should only be determined for small changes in x.\nTable 4.2: Linear-log model output for the food example\ndy = (%‚àÜx) (4.9)\nAnother quantity that might be of interest is the elasticity of y with respect to x, which is given by Equation 4.10 and indicates that a one percent increase in x produces a (Œ≤2/y) percent change in y.\nŒ≤2\n%‚àÜy = (%‚àÜx) (4.10)\ny\nLet us estimate a linear-log model for the food dataset, draw the regression curve, and calculate the marginal effects for some given values of the dependent variable.\nmod2 &lt;- lm(food_exp~log(income), data=food)\ntbl &lt;- data.frame(xtable(mod2)) kable(tbl, digits=5, caption=‚ÄúLinear-log model output for the food example‚Äù)\nThe results for an income of $1000 are as follows: dy/dx = 13.217, which indicates that an increase in income of $100 (i.e., one unit of x) increases expenditure by $\n4.4. RESIDUALS AND DIAGNOSTICS\nFigure 4.3: Linear-log representation for the food data\n13.217; for a 1% increase in income, that is, an increase of $10, expenditure increases by $ 1.322; and, finally, for a 1% increase in income expenditure incrases by 0.638%.\n4.4 Residuals and Diagnostics\nRegression results are reliable only to the extent to which the underlying assumptions are met. Plotting the residuals and calculating certain test statistics help deciding whether assumptions such as homoskedasticity, serial correlation, and normality of the errors are not violated. In R, the residuals are stored in the vector residuals of the regression output.\nehat &lt;- mod2\\(residuals plot(food\\)income, ehat, xlab=‚Äúincome‚Äù, ylab=‚Äúresiduals‚Äù)\nFigure 4.4 shows the residuals of the of the linear-log equation of the food expenditure example. One can notice that the spread of the residuals seems to be higher at higher incomes, which may indicate that the heteroskedasticity assumption is violated.\nLet us draw a residual plot generated with a simulated model that satisfies the regression assumptions. The data generating process is given by Equation 4.11, where x is a number between 0 and 10, randomly drawn from a uniform distribution, and the error term is randomly drawn from a standard normal distribution. Figure\nFigure 4.4: Residual plot for the food linear-log model 4.5 illustrates this simulated example.\nyi = 1 + xi + ei, i = 1,‚Ä¶,N (4.11)\nset.seed(12345) #sets the seed for the random number generator x &lt;- runif(300, 0, 10) e &lt;- rnorm(300, 0, 1) y &lt;- 1+x+e mod3 &lt;- lm(y~x) ehat &lt;- resid(mod3) plot(x,ehat, xlab=‚Äúx‚Äù, ylab=‚Äúresiduals‚Äù)\nThe next example illustrates how the residuals look like when a linear functional form is used when the true relationship is, in fact, quadratic. The data generating equation is given in Equation 4.12, where x is the same uniformly distributed between ‚àí2.5 and 2.5), and e ‚àº N(0,4). Figure 4.6 shows the residuals from estimating an incorrectly specified, linear econometric model when the correct specification should be quadratic.\nyi = 15 ‚àí 4x2i + ei, i = 1,‚Ä¶,N (4.12)\n4.4. RESIDUALS AND DIAGNOSTICS\nFigure 4.5: Residuals generated by a simulated regression model that satisfies the regression assumptions\nAnother assumption that we would like to test is the normality of the residuals, which assures reliable hypothesis testing and confidence intervals even in small samples. This assumption can be assessed by inspecting a histogram of the residuals, as well as performing a Jarque-Bera test, for which the null hypothesis is ‚ÄúSeries is normally distributed‚Äù. Thus, a small p-value rejects the null hypothesis, which means the series fails the normality test. The Jarque-Bera test requires installing and loading the package tseries in R. Figure 4.7 shows a histogram and a superimposed normal distribution for the linear food expenditure model.\nFigure 4.6: Simulated quadratic residuals from an incorrectly specified econometric model\njarque.bera.test(ehat) #(in package ‚Äòtseries‚Äô)",

POLYNOMIAL MODELS\nFigure 4.7: Histogram of residuals from the food linear model\nLab 5- Polynomial Models\nRegression models may include quadratic or cubic terms to better describe the nature of the dadta. The following is an example of quadratic and cubic model for the wa_wheat dataset, which gives annual wheat yield in tonnes per hectare in\nGreenough Shire in Western Australia over a period of 48 years. The linear model is given in Equation 4.13, where the subscript t indicates the observation period.\nyieldt = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2timet + et (4.13)\nFigure 4.8 shows a pattern in the residuals generated by the linear model, which may inspire us to think of a more appropriate functional form, such as the one in Equation 4.14.\nyieldt = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2time3t + et (4.14)\nFigure 4.8: Residuals from the linear wheatyield model\nPlease note in the following code sequence the use of the function I(), which is needed in R when an independent variable is transformed by mathematical operators. You do not need the operator I() when an independent variable is transformed through a function such as log(x). In our example, the transformation requiring the use of I() is raising time to the power of 3. Of course, you can create a new variable, x3=xÀÜ3 if you wish to avoid the use of I() in a regression equation.\nmod2 &lt;- lm(wa_wheat$greenough~I(time^3), data=wa_wheat)\nehat &lt;- resid(mod2) plot(wa_wheat$time, ehat, xlab=‚Äútime‚Äù, ylab=‚Äúresiduals‚Äù)\nFigure 4.9 displays a much better image of the residuals than Figure 4.8, since the residuals are more evenly spread about the zero line.\n4.6 Log-Linear Models\nTransforming the dependent variable with the log() function is useful when the variable has a skewed distribution, which is in general the case with amounts that cannot be negative. The log() transformation often makes the distribution closer to normal. The general log-linear model is given in Equation 4.15.\n4.6. LOG-LINEAR MODELS\nFigure 4.9: Residuals from the cubic wheatyield model\nlog(yi) = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2xi + ei (4.15)\nThe following formulas are easily derived from the log-linear Equation 4.15. The semi-elasticity has here a different interpretation than the one in the linear-log model: here, an increase in x by one unit (of x) produces a change of 100b2 percent in y. For small changes in x, the amount 100b2 in the log-linear model can also be interpreted as the growth rate in y (corresponding to a unit increase in x). For instance, if x is time, then 100b2 is the growth rate in y per unit of time.\nPrediction: yÀÜn = exp(b1 + b2x), or yÀÜc = exp(b1 + b2x + œÉÀÜ22), with the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù predictor yÀÜn to be used in small samples and the ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù predictor, yÀÜc, in large samples\nMarginal effect (slope): dxdy = b2y\nSemi-elasticity: %‚àÜy = 100b2‚àÜx\nLet us do these calculations first for the yield equation using the wa_wheat dataset.\nTable 4.3 gives b2 = 0.017844, which indicates that the rate of growth in wheat Table 4.3: Log-linear model for the yield equation\nTable 4.4: Log-linear ‚Äôwage‚Äô regression output\nproduction has increased at an average rate of approximately 1.78 percent per year.\nThe wage log-linear equation provides another example of calculating a growth rate, but this time the independent variable is not time, but education. The predictions and the slope are calculated for educ = 12 years.\nHere are the results of these calculations: ‚Äúnatural‚Äù prediction yÀÜn = 14.796; corrected prediction, yÀÜc = 16.996; growth rate g = 9.041; and marginal effect dxdy = 1.34. The growth rate indicates that an increase in education by one unit (see the data description using ?cps4_small) increases hourly wage by 9.041 percent.\nFigure 4.10 presents the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù and the ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù regression lines for the wage equation, together with the actual data points.\neducation=seq(0,22,2) yn &lt;- exp(b1+b2education) yc &lt;- exp(b1+b2education+sighat2/2)\n4.6. LOG-LINEAR MODELS\nFigure 4.10: The ‚Äônormal‚Äô and ‚Äôcorrected‚Äô regression lines in the log-linear wage equation\nplot(cps4_small\\(educ, cps4_small\\)wage, xlab=‚Äúeducation‚Äù, ylab=‚Äúwage‚Äù, col=‚Äúgrey‚Äù) lines(yn~education, lty=2, col=‚Äúblack‚Äù) lines(yc~education, lty=1, col=‚Äúblue‚Äù) legend(‚Äútopleft‚Äù, legend=c(‚Äúyc‚Äù,‚Äúyn‚Äù), lty=c(1,2), col=c(‚Äúblue‚Äù,‚Äúblack‚Äù))\nThe regular R2 cannot be used to compare two regression models having different dependent variables such as a linear-log and a log-linear models; when such a comparison is needed, one can use the general R2, which is Rg2 = [corr(y,yÀÜ]2. Let us calculate the generalized R2 for the quadratic and the log-linear wage models.\nrg5 &lt;- cor(cps4_small$wage,yhat5)^2\nThe quadratic model yields Rg2 = 0.188, and the log-linear model yields Rg2 = 0.186; since the former is higher, we conclude that the quadratic model is a better fit to the data than the log-linear one. (However, other tests of how the two models meet the assumptions of linear refgression may reach a different conclusion; R2 is only one of the model selection criteria.)\nTo determne a forecast interval estimate in the log-linear model, we first construct the interval in logs using the natural predictor yÀÜn, then take antilogs of the interval limits. The forecasting error is the same as before, given in Equation 4.4. The following calculations use an education level equal to 12 and Œ± = 0.05.\nThe result is the confidence interval (5.26, 41.62). Figure 4.11 shows a 95% confidence band for the log-linear wage model.\n4.7. THE LOG-LOG MODEL\nFigure 4.11: Confidence band for the log-linear wage equation\n4.7 The Log-Log Model\nThe log-log model has the desirable property that the coefficient of the independent variable is equal to the (constant) elasticity of y with respect to x. Therefore, this model is often used to estimate supply and demand equations. Its standard form is given in Equation 4.16, where y, x, and e are N √ó 1 vectors.\nlog(y) = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2log(x) + e (4.16)\nTable 4.5: The log-log poultry regression equation\nTable 4.5 gives the log-log regression output. The coefficient on p indicates that an increase in price by 1% changes the quantity demanded by ‚àí1.121%.",

The contents of this handbook are indicative, this means they can be updated or modified upon the review of the module leader (Cam).\nAn electronic version of this handbook (which is continuously updated) is available on the VLE system, Blackboard, which you should consult regularly as the main reference point throughout your studies.\nIndicative Contents\nVideo 1 - GLS: Known Form of Variance 5\nLecture 1 - Time-Series: Stationary Variables 13\nLecture 2 -Estimation with Serially Correlated Errors 25\nVideo 2 - Random Regressors 38\nLab 1 - Simultaneous Equations Models 46\nLab 2 Time Series: Non-stationarity 53\nLab 3 - Unit Root Tests for Stationarity 61\nLab 4 Cointegration 67\nLab 5 - VEC and VAR Models 71\nLab 6 - Estimating a VAR Model 76\nOptional Lab 1 - Time-Varying Volatility and ARCH Models 83\nOptional Lab 2 - Panel Data Models 91\nVideo 1 - GLS: Known Form of Variance\nPrerequisite:\nrm(list=ls()) #Removes all items in Environment! library(lmtest) #for coeftest() and bptest().\nlibrary(broom) #for glance() and tidy()\nlibrary(PoEdata) #for PoE4 datasets\nlibrary(car) #for hccm() robust standard errors\nlibrary(sandwich)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(stargazer)\nLet us consider the regression equation given in Equation 8.10), where the errors are assumed heteroskedastic.\nyi = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2xi + ei, var(ei) = œÉi (8.10)\nHeteroskedasticity implies different variances of the error term for each observation. Ideally, one should be able to estimate the N variances in order to obtain reliable standard errors, but this is not possible. The second best in the absence of such estimates is an assumption of how variance depends on one or several of the regressors. The estimator obtained when using such an assumption is called a generalized least squares estimator, gls, which may involve a structure of the errors as proposed in Equation 8.11, which assumes a linear relationship between variance and the regressor xi with the unknown parameter œÉ2 as a proportionality factor.\nTable 8.7: OLS estimates for the ‚Äôfood‚Äô equation\nvar(ei) = œÉi2 = œÉ2xi (8.11)\nOne way to circumvent guessing a proportionality factor in Equation 8.11 is to transform the initial model in Equation 8.10 such that the error variance in the new model has the structure proposed in Equation 8.11. This can be achieved if the initial model is divided through by and estimate the new model shown in Equation 8.12. If Equation 8.12 is correct, then the resulting estimator is BLUE.\nyi‚àó = Œ≤1x‚àói1 + Œ≤2x‚àói2 + e‚àói (8.12)\nIn general, if the initial variables are multiplied by quantities that are specific to each observation, the resulting estimator is called a weighted least squares estimator, wls. Unlike the robust standard errors method for heteroskedasticity correction, gls or wls methods change the estimates of regression coefficients.\nThe function lm() can do wls estimation if the argument weights is provided under the form of a vector of the same size as the other variables in the model. R takes the square roots of the weights provided to multiply the variables in the regression. Thus, if you wish to multiply the model by , the weights should be wi = .\nLet us apply these ideas to re-estimate the food equation, which we have determined to be affected by heteroskedasticity.\nw &lt;- 1/food$income\nfood.wls &lt;- lm(food_exp~income, weights=w, data=food)\nvcvfoodeq &lt;- coeftest(foodeq, vcov.=cov1)\nkable(tidy(foodeq), caption=‚ÄúOLS estimates for the ‚Äòfood‚Äô equation‚Äù)\nkable(tidy(food.wls),\ncaption=‚ÄúWLS estimates for the ‚Äòfood‚Äô equation‚Äù )\nkable(tidy(vcvfoodeq),caption= ‚ÄúOLS estimates for the ‚Äòfood‚Äô equation with robust standard errors‚Äù )\nTables 8.7, 8.8, and 8.9 compare ordinary least square model to a weighted least squares model and to OLS with robust standard errors.\nTable 8.8: WLS estimates for the ‚Äôfood‚Äô equation\nTable 8.9: OLS estimates for the ‚Äôfood‚Äô equation with robust standard errors\n‚àö\nThe WLS model multiplies the variables by , where the weights provided have to be w = 1/income. The effect of introducing the weights is a slightly lower intercept and, more importantly, different standard errors. Please note that the WLS standard errors are closer to the robust (HC1) standard errors than to the OLS ones.\n8.5 Grouped Data\nWe have seen already (Equation 8.7) how a dichotomous indicator variable splits the data in two groups that may have different variances. The generalized least squares method can account for group heteroskedasticity, by choosing appropriate weights for each group; if the variables are transformed by multiplying them by 1/œÉj, for group j, the resulting model is homoskedastic. Since œÉj is unknown, we replace it with its estimate œÉÀÜj. This method is named feasible generalized least squares.\nTable 8.10: OLS vs.¬†FGLS estimates for the ‚Äôcps2‚Äô data\nDependent variable: wage\nThe table titled ‚ÄúOLS, vs.¬†FGLS estimates for the ‚Äòcps2‚Äô data‚Äù helps comparing the coefficients and standard errors of four models: OLS for rural area, OLS for metro area, feasible GLS with the whole dataset but with two types of weights, one for each area, and, finally, OLS with heteroskedasticity-consistent (HC1) standard errors. Please be reminded that the regular OLS standard errors are not to be trusted in the presence of heteroskedasticity.\nThe previous code sequence needs some explanation. It runs two regression models, rural.lm and metro.lm just to estimate œÉÀÜR and œÉÀÜM needed to calculate the weights for each group. The subsets, this time, were selected directly in the lm() function through the argument subset=, which takes as argument some logical expression that may involve one or more variables in the dataset. Then, I create a new vector of a size equal to the number of observations in the dataset, a vector that will be populated over the next few code lines with weights. I choose to create this vector as a new column of the dataset cps2, a column named wght. With this the hard part is done; I just need to run an lm() model with the option weights=wght and that gives my FGLS coefficients and standard errors.\nThe next lines make a for loop runing through each observation. If observation i is a rural area observation, it receives a weight equal to 1/œÉR2 ; otherwise, it receives the weight 1/œÉM2 . Why did I square those sigmas? Because, remember, the argument weights in the lm() function requires the square of the factor multiplying the regression model in the WLS method.\nThe remaining part of the code repeats models we ran before and places them in one table for making comparison easier.\n8.6 GLS: Unknown Form of Variance\nSuppose we wish to estimate the model in Equation 8.13, where the errors are known to be heteroskedastic but their variance is an unknown function of S some variables zs that could be among the regressors in our model or other variables.\nyi = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2xi2 + ‚Ä¶Œ≤kxiK + ei (8.13)\nEquation 8.14 uses the residuals from Equation 8.13 as estimates of the variances of the error terms and serves at estimating the functional form of the variance. If the assumed functional form of the variance is the exponential function var(ei) = œÉi2 = œÉ2xŒ≥i , then the regressors zis in Equation 8.14 are the logs of the initial regressors xis, zis = log(xis).\nln(eÀÜ2i ) = Œ±1 + Œ±2zi2 + ‚Ä¶ + Œ±SziS + ŒΩi (8.14)\nThe variance estimates for each error term in Equation 8.13 are the fitted values, œÉÀÜi2 of Equation 8.14, which can then be used to construct a vector of weights for the regression model in Equation 8.13. Let us follow these steps on the food basic equation where we assume that the variance of error term i is an unknown exponential function of income. So, the purpose of the following code fragment is to determine the weights and to supply them to the lm() function. Remember, lm() multiplies each observation by the square root of the weight you supply. For instance, if you want to multiply the observations by 1/œÉi, you should supply the weight wi = 1/œÉi2.\nTable 8.11: Comparing various ‚Äôfood‚Äô models\nDependent variable: ‚Äôfood expenditure‚Äô\nThe table titled ‚ÄúComparing various ‚Äòfood‚Äô models‚Äù shows that the FGLS with unknown variances model substantially lowers the standard errors of the coefficients, which in turn increases the t-ratios (since the point estimates of the coefficients remain about the same), making an important difference for hypothesis testing.\nFor a few classes of variance functions, the weights in a GLS model can be calculated in R using the varFunc() and varWeights() functions in the package nlme.\n8.7 Heteroskedasticity in the Linear Probability Model\nAs we have already seen, the linear probability model is, by definition, heteroskedastic, with the variance of the error term given by its binomial distribution parameter p, the probability that y is equal to 1, var(y) = p(1‚àíp), where p is defined in Equation 8.15.\np = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2x2 + ‚Ä¶ + Œ≤KxK + e (8.15)\nThus, the linear probability model provides a known variance to be used with GLS, taking care that none of the estimated variances is negative. One way to avoid negative or greater than one probabilities is to artificially limit them to the interval (0,1).\nLet us revise the coke model in dataset coke using this structure of the variance.\ncoke.gls.omit &lt;- lm(coke~pratio+disp_coke+disp_pepsi, data=coke, weights=wght)\nTable 8.12: Comparing various ‚Äôcoke‚Äô models\nDependent variable: ‚Äôchoice of coke‚Äô\nLecture 1 - Time-Series: Stationary Variables\nNew packages: dynlm (Zeileis 2016); orcutt (Spada, Quartagno, and Tamburini\n2012); nlWaldTest (Komashko 2016); zoo [R-zoo]; pdfetch (Reinhart 2015); and forecast (Hyndman 2016).\nTime series are data on several variables on an observational unit (such as an individual, country, or firm) when observations span several periods. Correlation among subsequent observations, the importance of the natural order in the data and dynamics (past values of data influence present and future values) are features of time series that do not occur in cross-sectional data.\nTime series models assume, in addition to the usual linear regression assumptions, that the series is stationary, that is, the distribution of the error term, as well as the correlation between error terms a few periods apart are constant over time. Constant distribution requires, in particular, that the variable does not display a trend in its mean or variance; constant correlation implies no clustering of observations in certain periods.\n9.1 An Overview of Time Series Tools in R\nR creates a time series variable or dataset using the function ts(), with the following main arguments: your data file in matrix or data frame form, the start period, the end period, the frequency of the data (1 is annual, 4 is quarterly, and 12 is monthly), and the names of your column variables. Another class of time series objects is created by the function zoo() in the package zoo, which, unlike ts(), can handle irregular or high-frequency time series. Both ts and zoo classes of objects can be used by the function dynlm() in the package with the same name to solve models that include lags and other time series specific operators.\nIn standard R, two functions are very useful when working with time series: the difference function, diff(yt) = yt ‚àí yt‚àí1, and the lag function, lag(yt) = yt‚àí1.\nThe package pdfetch is a very useful tool for getting R-compatible time series data from different online sources such as the World Bank, Eurostat, European Central Bank, and Yahoo Finance. The package WDI retrieves data from the very rich World Development Indicators database, maintained by the World Bank.\n9.2 Finite Distributed Lags\nA finite distributed lag model (FDL) assumes a linear relationship between a dependent variable y and several lags of an independent variable x. Equation 9.1 shows a finite distributed lag model of order q.\nyt = Œ± + Œ≤0xt + Œ≤1xt‚àí1 + ‚Ä¶ + Œ≤qxt‚àíq + et (9.1)\nThe coefficient Œ≤s is an s-period delay multiplier, and the coefficient Œ≤0, the immediate (contemporaneous) impact of a change in x on y, is an impact multiplier. If x increases by one unit today, the change in y will be Œ≤0+Œ≤1+‚Ä¶+Œ≤s after s periods; this quantity is called the s-period interim multiplier. The total multiplier is equal to the sum of all Œ≤s in the model.\nLet us look at Okun‚Äôs law as an example of an FDL model. Okun‚Äôs law relates contemporaneous (time t) change in unemployment rate, DUt, to present and past levels of economic growth rate, Gt‚àís.\nTable 9.1: The ‚Äôokun‚Äò dataset with differences and lags\nTable 9.1 shows how lags and differences work. Please note how each lag uses up an observation period.\nTable 9.2: The ‚Äôokun‚Äò distributed lag model with three lags\nokunL3.dyn &lt;- dynlm(d(u)~L(g, 0:3), data=okun.ts) kable(tidy(summary(okunL3.dyn)), digits=4,\ncaption=‚ÄúThe okun distributed lag model with three lags‚Äù)\nTable 9.3: The ‚Äôokun‚Äò distributed lag model with two lags\nTables 9.2 and 9.3 summarize the results of linear models with 3 and 2 lags respectively. Many of the output analysis functions that we have used with the lm() function, such as summary() and coeftest() are also applicable to dynlm().\nTable 9.4: Goodness-of-fit statistics for ‚Äôokun‚Äò models\nTable 9.4 compares the two FDL models of the okun example. The first row is the model with three lags, the second is the model with two lags. All the measures in this table points to the second model (two lags) as a better specification.\nokunL2.dyn &lt;- dynlm(d(u)~L(g, 0:2), data=okun.ts) kable(tidy(summary(okunL2.dyn)), digits=4, caption=‚ÄúThe okun distributed lag model with two lags‚Äù)\nglL3 &lt;- glance(okunL3.dyn)[c(‚Äúr.squared‚Äù,‚Äústatistic‚Äù,‚ÄúAIC‚Äù,‚ÄúBIC‚Äù)] glL2 &lt;- glance(okunL2.dyn)[c(‚Äúr.squared‚Äù,‚Äústatistic‚Äù,‚ÄúAIC‚Äù,‚ÄúBIC‚Äù)]\ntabl &lt;- rbind(glL3, as.numeric(glL2)) kable(tabl, caption=‚ÄúGoodness-of-fit statistics for okun models‚Äù)\nA note on how these tables were created in R is of interest. Table 9.1 was created using the function cbind, which puts together several columns (vectors); table 9.4 used two functions: rbind(), which puts together two rows, and as.numeric, which extracts only the numbers from the glance object, without the names of the columns.\n9.3 Serial Correlation\nSerial correlation, or autocorrelation in a time series describes the correlation between two observations separated by one or several periods. Time series tend to display autocorrelation more than cross sections because of their ordered nature.\nFigure 9.1: Growth and unemployment rates in the ‚Äôokun‚Äô dataset\nAutocorrelation could be an attribute of one series, independent of the model in which this series appears. If this series is, however, an error term, its properties do depend on the model, since error series can only exist in relation to a model.\nplot(okun.ts[,‚Äúg‚Äù], ylab=‚Äúgrowth‚Äù)\nplot(okun.ts[,‚Äúu‚Äù], ylab=‚Äúunemployment‚Äù)\nThe ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù graph in Figure 9.1 display clusters of values: positive for several periods followed by a few of negative values, which is an indication of autocorrelation; the same is true for unemployment, which does not change as dramatically as growth but still shows persistence.\nFigures 9.2 illustrate the correlation between the growth rate and its first two lags, which is, indeed autocorrelation. But is there a more precise test to detect autocorrelation?\nFigure 9.2: Scatter plots between ‚Äôg‚Äô and its lags\nSuppose we wish to test the hypothesis formulated in Equation 9.2, where œÅk is the population k-th order autocorrelation coefficient.\n(9.2)\nA test can be constructed based on the sample correlation coefficient, rk, which measures the correlation between a variable and its k-th lag; the test statistic is given in Equation 9.3, where T is the number of periods.\n(9.3)\nFor a 5% significance level, Z must be outside the interval [‚àí1.96,1,96], that is, in the rejection region. Rejecting the null hypothesis is, in this case, bad news, since rejection constitutes evidence of autocorrelation. So, for a way to remember the meaning of the test, one may think of it as a test of non-autocorrelation.\nThe results of the (non-) autocorrelation test are usually summarized in a correlogram, a bar diagram that visualizes the values of the test statistic for several lags as well as the 95% confidence interval. A bar ( Trk) that exceeds (upward or downward) the limits of the confidence interval indicates autocorrelation for the corresponding lag.\ngrowth_rate &lt;- okun.ts[,‚Äúg‚Äù]\nacf(growth_rate)\nFigure 9.3 is a correlogram, where each bar corresponding to one lag, starting with lag 0. The correlogram shows little or no evidence of autocorrelation, except for the first and second lag (second and third bar in the figure).\nFigure 9.3: Correlogram for the growth rate, dataset ‚Äôokun‚Äô\nLet us consider another example, the dataset phillips_aus, which containes quarterly data on unemploymnt and inflation over the period 1987Q1 to 2009Q3. We wish to apply the autocorrelation test to the error term in a time series regression to see if the non-autocorrelation in the errors is violated. Let us consider the FDL model in Equation 9.4.\ninft = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2Dut + et (9.4)\nLet‚Äôs first take a look at plots of the data (visualising the data is said to be a good practice rule in data analysis.)\nThe plots in Figure 9.4 definitely show patterns in the data for both inflation and unemployment rates. But we are interested to determine if the error term in Equation\nFigure 9.4: Data time plots in the ‚Äôphillips‚Äô dataset\nTable 9.5: Summary of the ‚Äôphillips‚Äò model\n9.4 satisfies the non-autocorrelation assumption of the time series regression model.\nTable 9.5 gives a p-value of 0.0238, which is significant at a 5% level. But is this p-value reliable? Let us investigate the autocorrelation structure of the errors in this model.\nplot(ehat)\nabline(h=0, lty=2)\ncorrgm &lt;- acf(ehat)\nplot(corrgm)\nThe time series plot in Figure 9.5 suggests that some patterns exists in the residuals, which is confirmed by the correlogram in Figure 9.6. The previous result suggesting that there is a significant relationship between inflation and change in unemployment rate may not be, afterall, too reliable.\nWhile visualising the data and plotting the correlogram are powerful methods of spotting autocorrelation, in many applications we need a precise criterion, a test statistic to decide whether autocorrelation is a problem. One such a method is the Lagrange Multiplier test. Suppose we want to test for autocorrelation in the residuals the model given in Equation 9.5, where we assume that the errors have the autocorrelation structure described in Equation 9.6.\nFigure 9.5: Residuals of the Phillips equation\nFigure 9.6: Correlogram of the residuals in the Phillips model\nA test for autocorrelation would be based on the hypothesis in Equation 9.7.\n(9.7)\nAfter little algebraic manipulation, the auxiliary regression that the LM test actually uses is the one in Equation 9.8.\neÀÜt = Œ≥1 + Œ≥2xt + œÅeÀÜt‚àí1 + ŒΩt (9.8)\nThe test statistic is T √ó R2, where R2 is the coefficient of determination resulted from estimating the auxiliary equation (Equation 9.8). In R, all these calculations can be done in one command, bgtest(), which is the Breusch-Godfrey test for autocorrelation function. This function can test for autocorrelation of higher orders, which requires including higher lags for eÀÜ in the auxiliary equation.\nLet us do this test for the Phillips example. The next code sequence does the test first for only one lag and using an F-statistic; then, for lags up to 4, using a œá2-statistic. R does this test by either eliminating the first observations that are necessary to calculate the lags (fill=NA), or by setting them equal to zero (fill=0).\nTable 9.6: Breusch-Godfrey test for the Phillips example\nAll the four tests summarized in Table 9.6 reject the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation. The above code sequence requires a bit of explanation. The first four lines do the BG test on the previously estimated Phillips model (phill.dyn), using various parametrs: order tells R how many lags we want; type gives the test statistic to be used, either F or œá2; and, finally, fill tells R whether to delete the first observations or replace them with e = 0. The first column in Table 9.6 summarizes these options: number of lags, test statistic used, and how the missing observations are handeled.\nThe remaining of the code sequence is just to create a clear and convenient way of presenting the results of the four tests. As always, to inspect the content of an object like a type and run the command names(object).\nHow many lags should be considered when performing the autocorrelation test? One suggestion would be to limit the test to the number of lags that the correlogram shows to exceed the confidence band.\nR can perform another autocorrelation test, Durbin-Watson, which is being used less and less today because of its limitations. However, it may be considered when the sample is small. The following command can be used to perform this test:\ndwtest(phill.dyn)"

The similarity with heteroskedasticity goes even further: with autocorrelation it is possible to calculate correct (heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent, HAC) standard errors, known as Newey-West standard errors.\nTable 9.7: Comparing standard errors for the Phillips model\nTable 9.7 compares three versions of HAC standard errors for the Phillips equation plus the incorrect ones from the initial equation. The differences come from different choices for the methods of calculating them.\nThere are several functions in R that compute HAC standard errors, of which I choose three, all available in the package sandwich.\nCorrecting the standard errors in a model with autocorrelated errors does not make the estimator of the coefficients a minimum-variance one. Therefore, we would like to find better estimators, as we did in the case of heteroskedasticity. Let us look at models with a particular structure of the error term , a structure called first-order autoregressive process, or AR(1)model, described in Equation 9.9. The variable in this process is assumed to have zero mean and constant variance, œÉŒΩ2, and the errors ŒΩt should not be autocorrelated. In addition, the autocorrelation coefficient, œÅ, should take values in the interval (‚àí1,1). It can be shown that œÅ = corr(et,et‚àí1).\net = œÅet‚àí1 + ŒΩt (9.9)\nThe following code lines calculate and display the correlation coefficients for the first five lags in the residuals of the Phillips equation (Equation 9.4). Please notice that the autocorrelations tend to become smaller and smaller for distant lags, but they still remain higher than Equation 9.9 implies."

    "text": "1 0.557398\nComparing the nonlinear model with the two linear models (with, and without HAC standard errors) shows differences in both coefficients and standard errors. This is an indication that nonlinear estimation is a better choice than HAC standard errors. Please note that the NLS model provides an estimate of the autocorrelation coefficient, œÅ = 0.557.\n9.6 A More General Model\nEquation 9.12 gives an autoregresive distributed lag model, which is a generalization of the model presented in Equation 9.10. The two models are equivalent under the restriction Œ¥1 = ‚àíŒ∏1Œ¥0.\nyt = Œ¥ + Œ∏1yt‚àí1 + Œ¥0xt + Œ¥1xt‚àí1 + ŒΩt (9.12)\nEquation 9.13 is the Phillips version of the ARDL model given by Equation 9.12.\ninft = Œ¥ + Œ∏1inft‚àí1 + Œ¥0Dut + Œ¥1Dut‚àí1 + ŒΩt (9.13)\nA Wald test can be used to decide if the two models, the nonlinear one and the more general one are equivalent.\ns.nls &lt;- summary(phill.nls)\nphill.gen &lt;- dynlm(inf~L(inf)+d(u)+L(d(u)), data=phill.ts)\ns.gen &lt;- summary(phill.gen)\nnlW &lt;- nlWaldtest(phill.gen, texts=‚Äúb[4]=-b[2]*b[3]‚Äú)\nThe R function performing the Wald test is nlWaldtest in package nlWaldTest, which can test nonlinear restrictions. The result in our case is a œá2 value of 0.11227, with p-value of 0.737574, which does not reject the null hypothesis that the restriction Œ¥1 = ‚àíŒ∏1Œ¥0 cannot be rejected, making, in turn, Equations 9.11 and 9.13 equivalent.\nThe code lines above use the L and d from package dynlm for constructing lags and differences in time series. Unlike the similar functions that we have previously used (lag and diff), these do not work outside the command dynlm. Please note that constructing lags with lag() requires specifying the negative sign of the lag, which is not necessary for the L() function.\nTable 9.8: Using dynlm with L and d operators\nTable 9.9: Using dynlm with lag and diff operators\nphill1.gen &lt;- dynlm(inf~lag(inf, -1)+diff(u)+lag(diff(u), -1), data=phill.ts)\nThe results can be compared in Tables 9.8 and 9.9.\nkable(tidy(phill.gen), caption=‚ÄúUsing dynlm with L and d operators‚Äù)\nkable(tidy(phill1.gen), caption=‚ÄúUsing dynlm with lag and diff operators‚Äù)\n9.7 Autoregressive Models\nAn autoregressive model of order p, AR(p) (Equation 9.14) is a model with p lags of the response acting as independent variables and no other regressors.\nyt = Œ¥ + Œ∏1yt‚àí1 + Œ∏2yt‚àí2 + ‚Ä¶ + Œ∏pyt‚àíp + ŒΩt (9.14)\nThe next code sequence and Table 9.10 show an autoregressive model of order 2 using the series g in the data file okun.\nTable 9.10: Autoregressive model of order 2 using the dataset okun\nFigure 9.7: Residual correlogram for US GDP AR(2) model\nkable(tidy(okun.ar2), digits=4, caption=‚ÄúAutoregressive model of order 2 using the dataset \\(okun\\)‚Äù)\nHow can we decide how many lags to include in an autoregressive model? One way is to look at the correlogram of the series and include the lags that show autocorrelation. The follwing code creates the correlogram in the AR(2) residuals of the US GDP series. The correlogram in Figure 9.7 shows that basically only the first two lags may be included.\nres.ar2 &lt;- resid(okun.ar2) Acf(res.ar2, lag.max=12) # New: Acf() from package forecast\nAnother way of choosing the specification of an autoregressive model is to compare models of several orders and choose the one that provides the lowest AIC or BIC value.\nTable 9.11: Lag order selection for an AR model\nTable 9.11 displays the AIC and BIC (or SC) values for autoregressive models on the US GDP in dataset okun with number of lags from 1 to 5. (As mentioned before, the numbers do not coincide with those in PoE, but the ranking does.) The lowest AIC value indicates that the optimal model should include four lags, while the BIC values indicate the model with only two lags as the winner. Other criteria may be taken into account in such a situation, for instance the correlogram, which agrees with the BIC‚Äôs choice of model.\nThe previous code fragment needs some explanation. The first two lines initialize the vectors that are going to hold the AIC and BIC results. The problem of automatically changing the number of regressors is addressed by using the convenient function L(y, 1:i). AIC() and BIC() are basic R functions.\n9.8 Forecasting\nLet us consider first an autoregressive (AR) model, exemplified by the US GDP growth with two lags specified in Equation 9.15.\ngt = Œ¥ + Œ∏1gt‚àí1 + Œ∏2gt‚àí2 + ŒΩt (9.15)\nTable 9.12: The AR(2) growth model\nTable 9.13: Forecasts for the AR(2) growth model\nOnce the coefficients of this model are estimated, they can be used to predict (forecast) out-of-sample, future values of the response variable. Let us do this for periods T + 1, T + 2, and T + 3, where T is the last period in the sample. Equation 9.16 gives the forecast for period s into the future.\ngT+s = Œ¥ + Œ∏1gT+s‚àí1 + Œ∏2gT+s‚àí2 + ŒΩT+s (9.16)\ny &lt;- okun.ts[,‚Äúg‚Äù]\ng.ar2 &lt;- dynlm(y~L(y, 1:2))\nkable(tidy(g.ar2), caption=‚ÄúThe AR(2) growth model‚Äù)\nTable 9.12 shows the results of the AR(2) model. R uses the function forecast() in package forecast to automatically calculate forecasts based on autoregressive or other time series models. One such model is ar(), which fits an autoregressive model to a univariate time series. The arguments of ar() include: x= the name of the time series, aic=TRUE, if we want automatic selection of the number of lags based on the AIC information criterion; otherwise, aic=FALSE; order.max= the maximum lag order in the autoregressive model.\nar2g &lt;- ar(y, aic=FALSE, order.max=2, method=‚Äúols‚Äù)\nfcst &lt;- data.frame(forecast(ar2g, 3))\nkable(fcst, digits=3, caption=‚ÄúForecasts for the AR(2) growth model‚Äù)\nTable 9.13 shows the forecasted values for three future periods based on the AR(2) growth model.\nFigure 9.8: Forecasts and confidence intervals for three future periods\nplot(forecast(ar2g,3))\nFigure 9.8 illustrates the forecasts produced by the AR(2) model of US GDP and their interval estimates.\nUsing more information under the form of additional regressors can improve the accuracy of forecasting. We have already studied ARDL models; let us use such a model to forecast the rate of unemployment based on past unemployment and GDP growth data. The dataset is still okun, and the model is an ARDL(1,1) as the one in Equation 9.17.\n(9.17)\nSince we are interested in forecasting levels of unemployment, not differences, we want to transform the ARDL(1,1) model in Equation 9.17 into the ARDL(2,1) one in Equation 9.18.\n(9.18)\nAnother forecasting model is the exponential smoothing one, which, like the AR model, uses only the variable to be forecasted. In addition, the exponential smoothing model requires a weighting parameter, Œ±, and an initial level of the forecasted variable, yÀÜ. Next period‚Äôs forecast is a weighted average of this period‚Äôs level and this period‚Äôs forecast, as indicated in Equation 9.19.\nFigure 9.9: Exponential smoothing forecast using ‚Äôets‚Äô\nyÀÜT+1 = Œ±yT + (1 ‚àí Œ±)yÀÜT (9.19)\nThere are sevaral ways to compute an exponential smoothing forecast in R. I only use two here, for comparison. The first is the function ets() in the forecast package.\nThe results include the computed value of the weight, Œ± = 0.381, the point estimate of the growth rate gT+1 = 0.054, and the 95 percent interval estimate (‚àí1.051,1.158). Figure 9.9 illustrates these results.\nThe second method uses the function HoltWinters and is shown in the following code fragment.\nokun.HW &lt;- HoltWinters(y, beta=FALSE, gamma=FALSE)\nplot(okun.HW)\nFigure 9.10: Exponential smoothing forecast using ‚ÄôHoltWinters‚Äô\nokunf.HW &lt;- forecast(okun.HW,1)\nSimilar to the ets function, HoltWinters automatically determines the optimal weight Œ± of the exponential smoothing model. In our case, the value is Œ± = 0.381. The point estimate is gT+1 = 0.054, and the 95 percent interval estimate is (‚àí1.06,1.168). Figure 9.10 compares the forecasted with the actual series.\n9.9 Multiplier Analysis\nIn an ARDL(p,q) model, if one variable changes at some period it affects the response over several subsequent periods. Multiplier analysis quantifies these time effects. Let me remind you the form of the ARDL(p,q) model in Equation 9.20.\nyt = Œ¥ + Œ∏1yt‚àí1 + ‚Ä¶ + Œ∏pyt‚àíp + Œ¥0xt + Œ¥1xt‚àí1 + ‚Ä¶ + Œ¥qxt‚àíq + ŒΩt (9.20)\nThe model in Equation 9.20 can be transformed by iterative substitution in an infinite distributed lag model, which includes only explanatory variables with no lags of the response. The transformed model is shown in Equation 9.21.\nyt = Œ± + Œ≤0xt + Œ≤1xt‚àí1 + Œ≤2xt‚àí2 + Œ≤3xt‚àí3 + ‚Ä¶ + et (9.21)\nCoefficient Œ≤s in Equation 9.21 is called the s-period delay multiplier; the sum of the Œ≤s from today to period s in the past is called interim multiplier, and the sum of all periods to infinity is called total multiplier.\nVideo 2 - Random Regressors\nIn most data coming from natural, non-controlled phenomena, both the dependent and independent variables are random. In many cases, some of the independent variables are also correlated with the error term in a regression model, which makes the OLS method inappropriate. Regressors (x) that are correlated with the error term are called endogeneous; likewise, those that are not are called exogeneous. The remedy for this violation of the linear regression assumption is the use of instrumental variables, or instruments, which are variables (z) that do not directly influence the response but are correlated with the endogenous regressor in question.\n10.1 The Instrumental Variables (IV) Method\nA strong instrument, one that is highly correlated with the endogenous regressor it concerns, reduces the variance of the estimated coefficient. Assume the multiple regression model in Equation 10.1, where regressors x2 to xK‚àí1 are exogenous and xK is endogenous. The IV method consists in two stages: first regress xK on all the other regressors and all the instruments and create the fitted values series, xÀÜK; second, regress the initial equation, in which xK is replaced by xÀÜK. Therefore, the IV method is often called two-stage least squares, or 2SLS.\nTable 10.1: First stage in the 2SLS model for the ‚Äôwage‚Äô equation\ny = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2x2 + ‚Ä¶ + Œ≤KxK + e (10.1)\nConsider the wage model in Equation 10.2 using the mroz dataset. The notorious difficulty with this model is that the error term may include some unobserved attributes, such as personal ability, that determine both wage and education. In other words, the independent variable educ is correlated with the error term, is\nendogenous.\nlog(wage) = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2educ + Œ≤3exper + Œ≤4exper2 + e (10.2)\nAn instrument that may address the endogeneity of educ is mothereduc, of which we can reasonably assume that it does not directly influence the daughter‚Äôs wage, but it influences her education.\nLet us first carry out an explicit two-stage model with only one instrument, mothereduc. The first stage is to regress educ on other regressors and the instrument, as Equation 10.3 shows.\neduc = Œ≥1 + Œ≥2exper + Œ≥3exper2 + Œ∏1mothereduc + ŒΩeduc (10.3)\nThe p-value for mothereduc is very low (see Table 10.1), indicating a strong correlation between this instrument and the endogenous variable educ aven after controling for other variables. The second stage in the two-stage procedure is to create the fitted values of educ from the first stage (Equation 10.3) and plug them into the model of interest, Euation 10.2 to replace the original variable educ.Table 10.2: Second stage in the 2SLS model for the ‚Äôwage‚Äô equation\nThe results of the explicit 2SLS procedure are shown in Table 10.2; keep n mind, however, that the standard errors calculated in this way are incorrect; the correct method is to use a dedicated software function to solve an instrumental variable model. In R, such a function is ivreg().\nmodel.numbers = FALSE,\ndep.var.caption=‚ÄúDependent variable: wage‚Äù,\nmodel.names=FALSE, star.char=NULL) #supresses the stars)\nTable 10.3: Wage equation: OLS, 2SLS, and IV models compared\nThe table titled ‚ÄúWage equation: OLS, 2SLS, and IV compared‚Äù shows that the importance of education in determining wage decreases in the IV model. It also shows that the explicit 2SLS model and the IV model with only mothered instrument yield the same coefficients (the educ in the IV model is equivalent to the educHat in 2SLS), but the standard errors are different. The correct ones are those provided by the IV model.\nA few observations are in order concerning the above code sequence. First, since some of the individuals are not in the labor force, their wages are zero and the log cannot be calculated. I excluded those observations using only those for which lpf is equal to 1. Second, the instrument list in the command ivreg includes both the instrument itself (mothereduc) and all exogenous regressors, which are, so to speak, their own instruments. The vertical bar character | separates the proper regressor list from the instrument list.\nTable 10.4: The ‚Äôeduc‚Äô first-stage equation\nTo test for weak instruments in the wage equation, we just test the joint significance of the instruments in an educ model as shown in Equation 10.4. educ = Œ≥1 + Œ≥2exper + Œ≥3exper2 + Œ∏1mothereduc + Œ∏2fathereduc + ŒΩ (10.4)\nlinearHypothesis(educ.ols, c(‚Äúmothereduc=0‚Äù, ‚Äúfathereduc=0‚Äù))\nThe test rejects the null hypothesis that both mothereduc and fathereduc coefficients are zero, indicating that at least one instrument is strong. A rule of thumb requires to soundly reject the null hypothesis at a value of the F-statistic greater than 10 or, for only one instrument, a t-statistic greater than 3.16, to make sure that an instrument is strong.\nFor a model to be identified the number of instruments should be at least equal to the number of endogenous variables. If there are more instruments than endogenous variables, the model is said to be overidentified.\n10.2 Specification Tests\nWe have seen before how to test for weak instruments with only one instrument. This test can be extended to several instruments. The null hypothesis is H0: ‚ÄúAll instruments are weak‚Äù.\nSince using IV when it is not necessary worsens our estimates, we would like to test whether the variables that worry us are indeed endogenous. This problem is addressed by the Hausman test for endogeneity, where the null hypothesis is H0 : Cov(x,e) = 0. Thus, rejecting the null hypothesis indicates the existence of endogeneity and the need for instrumental variables.\nThe test for the validity of instruments (whether the instruments are corrrelated with the error term) can only be performed for the extra instruments, those that are in excess of the number of endogenous variables. This test is sometimes called a test for overidentifying restrictions, or the Sargan test. The null hypothesis is that the covariance between the instrument and the error term is zero, H0 : Cov(z,e) = 0. Thus, rejecting the null indicates that at least one of the extra instruments is not valid.\nR automatically performs these three tests and reports the results in the output to the ivreg function.\nsummary(mroz1.iv1, diagnostics=TRUE)"

    "text": "Wald test: 8.14 on 3 and 424 DF, p-value: 0.0000279\nThe results for the wage equation are as follows:\nWeak instruments test: rejects the null, meaning that at least one instrument is strong\n(Wu-)Hausman test for endogeneity: barely rejects the null that the variable of concern is uncorrelated with the error term, indicating that educ is marginally endogenous\nSargan overidentifying restrictions: does not reject the null, meaning that the extra instruments are valid (are uncorrelated with the error term).\nThe test for weak instruments might be unreliable with more than one endogenous regressor, though, because there is indeed one F-statistic for each endogenous regressor. An alternative is the Cragg-Donald test based on the statistic shown in Equation 10.5, where G is the number of exogenous regressors, B is the number of endogenous regressors, L is the number of external instruments, and rB is the lowest canonical correlation (a measure of the correlation between the endogenous and the exogenous variables, calculated by the function cancor() in R).\n(10.5)\nLet us look at the hours equation with two endogenous variables, mtr and educ, and two external instruments, mothereduc and fathereduc. One of the two exogenous regressors, nwifeinc, is the family income net of the wife‚Äôs income; the other exogenous regressor, mtr, is the wife‚Äôs marginal tax rate. Equation 10.6 shows this model; the dataset is mroz, restricted to women that are in the labor force.\nhours = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2mtr + Œ≤3educ + Œ≤4kidsl6 + Œ≤5nwifeinc + e (10.6)\nThe next code sequence uses the R function cancor() to calculate the lowest of two canonical correlations, rB, which is needed for the Cragg-Donald F-statistic in Equation 10.5.\nThe result is the Cragg-Donald F = 0.100806, which is much smaller than the critical value of 4.58 given in Table 10E.1 of the textbook (Hill, Griffiths, and Lim 2011). This test rejects the null hypothesis of strong instruments, contradicting my previous result.\nLab 1 - Simultaneous Equations Models\nrm(list=ls()) #Removes all items in Environment!\nlibrary(systemfit)\nlibrary(broom) #for glance() and tidy() library(PoEdata) #for PoE4 dataset library(knitr) #for kable()\nNew package: systemfit (Henningsen and Hamann 2015).\nSimultaneous equations are models with more than one response variable, where the solution is determined by an equilibrium among opposing forces. The econometric problem is similar to the endogenous variables we have studied already in the previous chapter because the mutual interaction between dependent variables can be considered a form of endogeneity. The typical example of an economic simultaneous equation problem is the supply and demand model, where price and quantity are interdependent and are determined by the interaction between supply and demand.\nUsually, an economic model such as demand and supply equations include several of the depednedent (endogenous) variables in each equation. Such a model is called the structural form of the model. If the structural form is transformed such that each equation shows one dependent variable as a function of only exogenous independent variables, the new form is called the reduced form. The reduced form can be estimated by least squares, while the structural form cannot because it includes endogenous variables on its right-hand side.\nThe necessary condition for identification requires that, for the problem to have a solution each equation in the structural form of the system should miss at least an exogenous variable that is present in other equations.\nSimultaneous equations are the object of package systemfit in R, with the func-\n169\ntion systemfit(), which requires the following main arguments: formula= a list describing the equations of the system; method= the desired (appropriate) method of estimation, which can be one of ‚ÄúOLS‚Äù, ‚ÄúWLS‚Äù, ‚ÄúSUR‚Äù, ‚Äú2SLS‚Äù, ‚ÄúW2SLS‚Äù, or ‚Äú3SLS‚Äù (we have only studied OLS, WLS, and 2SLS so far); inst= a list of instrumental variables under the form of one-sided model formulas; all the endogenous variables in the system must be in this list.\nThe following example uses the dataset truffles, where q is quantity of truffles traded, p is the market price, ps is the price of a substitute, di is income, and pf is a measure of costs of production. The structural demand and supply equations (Equations 11.1 and 11.2) are formulated based on economic theory; quantity and price are endogenous, and all the other variables are considered exogenous."

    "text": "Multiple R-Squared: 0.90188 Adjusted R-Squared: 0.89461\nThe output of the systemfit() function shows the estimates by structural equation:eq1is the demand function, where, as expected, price has a negative sign, andeq2‚Äò is the supply equation, with a positive sign for price.\nTable 11.1: Reduced form for quantity\nTable 11.2: Reduced form for price\nBy evaluating the reduced form equation using OLS, one can determinne the effects of changes in exogenous variables on the equilibrium market price and quantity, while the structural equations show the effects of such changes on the quantity demanded, respectively on the quantity supplied. Estimating the structural equations by such methods as 2SLS is, in fact, estimating the market demand and supply curves, which is extremly useful for economic analysis. Estimating the reduced forms, while being useful for prediction, does not allow for deep analysis - it only gives the equilibrium point, not the whole curves.\nQ.red &lt;- lm(q~ps+di+pf, data=truffles)\nP.red &lt;- lm(q~ps+di+pf, data=truffles) kable(tidy(Q.red), digits=4, caption=‚ÄúReduced form for quantity‚Äù)\nkable(tidy(P.red), digits=4, caption=‚ÄúReduced form for price‚Äù)\nTables 11.1 and 11.2 show that all the exogenous variables have significant effects on the equilibrium quantity and price and have the expected signs.\nThe fultonfish dataset provides another demand and supply example where the simultaneous equations method can be applied. The purpose of this example is to emphasize that the exogenous variables that are key for identification must be statistically significant. Otherwise, the structural equation that needs to be identified by those variables cannot be reliably estimated. The remaining equations in the structural system are, however, not affected.\nlog(quan) = Œ±1 + Œ±2log(price) + Œ±3mon + Œ±4tue + Œ±4wed + Œ±5thu + eD (11.3)\nlog(quan) = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2log(price) + Œ≤3stormy + eS (11.4)\nIn the fultonfish example, the endogenous variables are lprice, the log of price, and lquan; the exogenous variables are the indicator variables for the day of the week, and whether the catching day was stormy. The identification variable for the demand equation is stormy, which will only show up in the supply equation; the identification variables for the supply equation will be mon, tue, wed, and thu. log(q) = œÄ11 + œÄ21mon + œÄ31tue + œÄ41wed + œÄ51thu + œÄ61stormy + ŒΩ1 (11.5)\nlog(p) = œÄ12 + œÄ22mon + œÄ32tue + œÄ42wed + œÄ52thu + œÄ62stormy + ŒΩ2 (11.6)\nNow, let us consider the reduced form equations (Equations 11.5 and 11.6). Since the endogenous variable that appears in the right-hand side of the structural equations (Equations 11.3 and 11.4) is price, the price reduced equation (Equation 11.6) is essential for evaluating the identification state of the model. Let us focus on this equation. If the weekday indicators are all insignificant, the supply equation cannot be identified; if stormy turns out insignificant, the demand equation cannot be identified; if the weekday indicators are insignificat but stormy is significant the supply is not identified, but the demand is; if at least one weekday indicator turns out significant but stormy turns out insignificant, the demand equation is not identified but the supply equation is. Equations 11.3 and 11.4 display the structural demand and supply equations for the fultonfish example.\ndata(‚Äúfultonfish‚Äù, package=‚ÄúPoEdata‚Äù)\nfishQ.ols &lt;- lm(lquan~mon+tue+wed+thu+stormy, data=fultonfish)\nkable(tidy(fishQ.ols), digits=4, caption=‚ÄúReduced ‚ÄòQ‚Äô equation for the fultonfish example‚Äù)\nfishP.ols &lt;- lm(lprice~mon+tue+wed+thu+stormy, data=fultonfish)\nkable(tidy(fishP.ols), digits=4, caption=‚ÄúReduced ‚ÄòP‚Äô equation for the fultonfish example‚Äù)\nThe relevant equation for evaluating identification is shown in Table 11.4, which is the price reduced equation. The results show that the weekday indicators are not Table 11.3: Reduced ‚ÄôQ‚Äô equation for the fultonfish example\nTable 11.4: Reduced ‚ÄôP‚Äô equation for the fultonfish example\nsignificant, which will make the 2SLS estimation of the supply equation unreliable; the coefficient on stormy is significant, thus the estimation of the (structural) demand equation will be reliable. The following code sequence and output show the 2SLS estimates of the demand and supply (the structural) equations."

Nonstationary time series cannot be used in regression models because they may create spurious regression, a false relationship due to, for instance, a common trend in otherwise unrelated variables. Two or more nonstationary series can still be part of a regression model if they are cointegrated, that is, they are in a stationary relationship of some sort.\nWe are concerned with testing time series for nonstationarity and finding out how can we transform nonstationary time series such that we can still use them in regression analysis.\ndata(‚Äúusa‚Äù, package=‚ÄúPoEdata‚Äù)\nusa.ts &lt;- ts(usa, start=c(1984,1), end=c(2009,4), frequency=4)\nDgdp &lt;- diff(usa.ts[,1])\n177\nTable 12.1: Time series data frame constructed with ‚Äôts.union‚Äô\nA novelty in the above code sequence is the use of the function ts.union, wich binds together several time series, with the possibility of constructing a data frame.

According to the Dickey-Fuller test, a time series is nonstationary when œÅ = 1, which makes the AR(1) process a random walk. The null and alternative hypotheses of the test is given in Equation 12.3.\nH0 : œÅ = 1, HA : œÅ &lt; 1 (12.3)\nThe basic AR(1) equations mentioned above are transformed, for the purpose of the\nFigure 12.5: A plot and correlogram for series f in dataset usa\nDF test into Equation 12.4, with the transformed hypothesis shown in Equation\n12.5.

The DF test can be of three types: with no constant and no trend, with constsnt and no trend, and, finally, with constant and trend. It is important to specify which DF test we want because the critical values are different for the three different types of the test. One decides which test to perform by examining a time series plot of the variable and determine if an imaginary regression line would have an intercept and a slope.\nLet us apply the DF test to the f series in the usa dataset.\nplot(usa.ts.df\\(f) Acf(usa.ts.df\\)f)\nThe time series plot in Figure 12.5 indicates both intercept and trend for our series, while the correlogram suggests including 10 lags in the DF test equation. Suppose we choose Œ± = 0.05 for the DF test. The adf.test function does not require specifying whether the test should be conducted with constant or trend, and if no value for the number of lags is given (the argument for the number of lags is k), R will calculate a value for it. I would recommend always taking a look at the series‚Äô plot and correlogram.\nadf.test(usa.ts.df$f, k=10)"

The short run error correction model combines, in some sense, short run and long run effects. Starting from an ARDL(1,1) model (Equation 12.6) and assuming that there is a steady state (long run) relationship between y and x, one can derive the error correction model in Equation 12.7, where more lagged differences of x may be necessary to eliminate autocorrelation.\nyt = Œ¥ + Œ∏1yt‚àí1 + Œ¥0xt + Œ¥1xt‚àí1 + ŒΩt (12.6)\n‚àÜyt = ‚àíŒ±(yt‚àí1 ‚àí Œ≤1 ‚àí Œ≤2xt‚àí1) + Œ¥0‚àÜxt + ŒΩt (12.7)\nIn the case of the US bonds and funds example, the error correction model can be constructed as in Equation 12.8.\n‚àÜbt = ‚àíŒ±(bt‚àí1 ‚àí Œ≤1 ‚àí Œ≤2ft‚àí1) + Œ¥0‚àÜft + Œ¥1‚àÜft‚àí1 + ŒΩt (12.8)\nThe R function that estimates a nonlinear model such as the one in Equation 12.8 is nls, which requires three main argumants: a formula, which is the regression model to be estimated written using regular text mathematical operators, a start= list of guessed or otherwise approximated values of the estimated parameters to initiate a Gauss-Newton numerical optimization process, and data= a data frame, list, or environment data source. Please note that data cannot be a matrix.\nIn the next code sequence, the initial values of the parameters have been determined by estimating Equation 12.6 with b and f replacing y and x.\nb.ols &lt;- dynlm(L(b)~L(f)) b1ini &lt;- coef(b.ols)[1] b2ini &lt;- coef(b.ols)[[2]]\nd.ols &lt;- dynlm(b~L(b)+f+L(f)) aini &lt;- 1-coef(d.ols)[[2]] d0ini &lt;- coef(d.ols)[[3]] d1ini &lt;- coef(d.ols)[[4]]\nDb &lt;- diff(b)\nTable 12.2: Parameter estimates in the error correction model\nTable 12.3: Stationarity test within the error correction model\nThe error correction model can also be used to test the two series for cointegration. All we need to do is to test the errors of the correction part embedded in Equation 12.8 for stationarity. The estimated errors are given by Equation 12.9.\neÀÜt‚àí1 = bt‚àí1 ‚àí Œ≤1 ‚àí Œ≤2ft‚àí1 (12.9)\nehat &lt;- bfset\\(Lb-coef(bf.nls)[[2]]-coef(bf.nls)[[3]]*bfset\\)Lf ehat &lt;- ts(ehat)\nehat.adf &lt;- dynlm(d(ehat)~L(ehat)+L(d(ehat))-1)\nkable(tidy(ehat.adf),\ncaption=‚ÄúStationarity test within the error correction model‚Äù)\nfoo &lt;- tidy(ehat.adf)\nTo test for cointegration, one should compare the t-ratio of the lagged term shown as ‚Äòstatistic‚Äô in Equation 12.3, t = ‚àí3.927 to the critical value of ‚àí3.37. The result is to reject the null of no cointegration, which means the series are cointegrated.\nLab 5 - VEC and VAR Models\nNew package: vars (Pfaff 2013).\nWhen there is no good reason to assume a one-way causal relationship between two time series variables we may think of their relationship as one of mutual interaction. The concept of ‚Äúvector,‚Äù as in vector error correction refers to a number of series in such a model.\n13.1 VAR and VEC Models\nEquations 13.1 and 13.1 show a generic vector autoregression model of order 1, VAR(1), which can be estimated if the series are both I(0). If they are I(1), the same equations need to be estimated in first differences.\n195\ny\nIf the two variables in Equations 13.1 and 13.2 and are cointegrated, their cointegration relationship should be taken into account in the model, since it is valuable information; such a model is called vector error correction. The cointegration relationship is, remember, as shown in Equation 13.3, where the error term has been proven to be stationary.\nyt = Œ≤0 + Œ≤1xt + et (13.3)\n13.2 Estimating a VEC Model\nThe simplest method is a two-step procedure. First, estimate the cointegrating relationship given in Equation 13.3 and created the lagged resulting residual series eÀÜt‚àí1 = yt‚àí1 ‚àí b0 ‚àí b1xt‚àí1. Second, estimate Equations 13.4 and 13.5 by OLS.\nThe following example uses the dataset gdp, which includes GDP series for Australia and USA for the period since 1970:1 to 2000:4. First we determine the order of integration of the two series.\nFigure 13.1 represents the two series in levels, revealing a common trend and, therefore, suggesting that the series are nonstationary.\n13.2.

The dotted lines show the 95 percent interval estimates of these effects. The VAR function prints the values corresponding to the impulse response graphs.\nplot(fevd(varfit)) # fevd() is in package vars\nForecast variance decomposition estimates the contribution of a shock in each variable to the response in both variables. Figure 13.5 shows that almost 100 percent of the variance in Dc is caused by Dc itself, while only about 80 percent in the variance of Dy is caused by Dy and the rest is caused by Dc.

The panel is balanced if all units are observed in all periods; if some units are missing in some periods, the panel is unbalanced. Equation 15.1 gives the form of a pooled panel data model, where the subscript i = 1,‚Ä¶,N denotes an individual (cross sectional unit), and t = 1,‚Ä¶,T denotes the time period, or longitudinal unit. The total number of observations in the panel is N √ó T.\nyit = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2x2it + ‚Ä¶ + Œ≤KxKit + eit (15.1)\n217\n15.1 Organizing the Data as a Panel\nA wide panel has the cross-sectional dimension (N) much larger than the longitudinal dimension (T); when the opposite is true, we have a long panel. Normally, the same units are observed in all periods; when this is not the case and each period samples mostly other units, the result is not a proper panel data, but pooled cross-sections model.\nThis manual uses the panel data package plm(), which also gives the possibility of organizing the data under the form of a panel. Panel datsets can be organized in mainly two forms: the long form has a column for each variable and a row for each individual-period; the wide form has a column for each variable-period and a row for each individual. Most panel data methods require the long form, but many data sources provide one wide-form table for each variable; assembling the data from different sources into a long form data frame is often not a trivial matter.\nThe next code sequence creates a panel structure for the dataset nls_panel using the function pdata.frame of the plm package and displays a small part of this dataset.\nPlease note how the selection of the rows and columns to be displayed is done, using the compact operator %in% and arrays such as c(1:6, 14:15). Table 15.1 shows this sample.\nFunction pdim() extracts the dimensions of the panel data:\npdim(nlspd)"

THE FIXED EFFECTS MODEL\nTable 15.4: Fixed effects in a subsample\nTable 15.4 displays the results of an OLS regression on a subsample of the first 10 individuals in the dataset nls_panel. The table is generated by the previous code sequence, where the novelty is using the factor variable id. The function factor() generates dummy variables for all categories of the variable, taking the first category as the reference. To include the reference in the output, one needs to exclude the constant from the regression model by including the term ‚àí1 in the regression formula. When the constant is not excluded, the coefficients of the dummy variables represent, as usual, the difference between the respective category and the benchmark one.\nHowever, to estimate a fixed effects in R we do not need to create the dummy variables, but use the option model=‚Äúwithin‚Äù in the plm() function. The following code fragment uses the whole sample.\nTable 15.5: Fixed effects using ‚Äôwithin‚Äô with full sample\nTable 15.6: Fixed effects using the ‚Äôwithin‚Äô model option for n=10\nTable 15.6 presents the fixed effects model results for the subsample of 10 individuals of the dataset nls_panel. This is to be compared to Table 15.4 to see that the within method is equiivalent to including the dummies in the model. An interesting comparison is between the pooled and fixed effect models. Comparing Table 15.2 with Table 15.5 one can notice that including accounting for individual heterogeneity significantly lowers the marginal effects of the variables.\nTesting if fixed effets are necessary is to compare the fixed effects model wage.within with the pooled model wage.pooled. The function pFtest() does this comparison, as in the following code lines.\nkable(tidy(pFtest(wage.within, wage.pooled)), caption=\n‚ÄúFixed effects test: Ho:‚ÄòNo fixed effects‚Äô‚Äù)\nTable 15.7 shows that the null hypothesis of no fixed effects is rejected.\n15.4. THE RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL\nTable 15.7: Fixed effects test: Ho:‚ÄôNo fixed effects‚Äô\n15.4 The Random Effects Model\nThe random effects model elaborates on the fixed effects model by recognizing that, since the individuals in the panel are randomly selected, their characteristics, measured by the intercept Œ≤1i should also be random. Thus, the random effects\nmodel assumes the form of the intercept as given in Equation 15.3, where Œ≤1 stands for the population average and ui represents an individual-specific random term. As in the case of fixed effects, random effects are also time-invariant.\nŒ≤1i = Œ≤1 + ui (15.3)\nIf this form of the intercept is replaced in Equation 15.2, the result looks like Equation 15.4.\nyit = Œ≤1 + Œ≤2x2it + ŒΩit (15.4)\nThe intercept is here, unlike the fixed effects model constant across individuals, but the error termm, ŒΩit, incorporates both individual specifics and the initial regression error term, as Equation 15.5 shows.\nŒΩit = ui + eit (15.5)\nThus, the random effects model is distinguished by the special structure of its error term: errors have zero mean, a variance equal to œÉu2 + œÉe2, uncorrelated across individuals, and having timewise covariance equal to œÉu2.\nAn important feature of the random effects model is that the timewise correlation in the errors does not decline over time (see Equation 15.6).\nœÉ2\nœÅ = corr(ŒΩit,ŒΩis) = 2 +uœÉe2 (15.6) œÉu\nTesting for random effects amounts to testing the hypothesis that there are no differences among individuals, which implies that the individual-specific random variable has zero variance. Equation 15.7 shows the hypothesis to be tested.\nTable 15.8: A random effects test for the wage equation\nH0 : œÉu2 = 0, HA : œÉu2 &gt; 0 (15.7)\nThe same function we used for fixed effects can be used for random effects, but setting the argument model= to ‚Äòrandom‚Äô and selecting the random.method as one out of four possibilities: ‚Äúswar‚Äù (default), ‚Äúamemiya‚Äù, ‚Äúwalhus‚Äù, or ‚Äúnerlove‚Äù. The random effects test function is plmtest(), which takes as its main argument the pooling model (indeed it extracts the residuals from the pooling object).\nTable 15.8 shows that the null hypothesis of zero variance in individual-specific errors is rejected; therefore, heterogeneity among individuals may be significant.\nRandom effects estimator are reliable under the assumption that individual characteristics (heterogeneity) are exogenous, that is, they are independent with respect to the regressors in the random effects equation. The same Hausman test for endogeneity we have already used in another chapter can be used here as well, with the null hypothesis that individual random effects are exogenous. The test function phtest() compares the fixed effects and the random effects models; the next code lines estimate the random effects model and performs the Hausman endogeneity test.\nkable(tidy(phtest(wage.within, wage.random)), caption=\n‚ÄúHausman endogeneity test for the random effects wage model‚Äù)\nTable 15.10 shows a low p-value of the test, which indicates that the null hypothesis saying that the individual random effects are exogenous is rejected, which makes the random effects equation inconsistent. In this case the fixed effects model is the correct solution. (The number of parameters in Table 15.10 is given for the time-varying variables only.)\n15.4. THE RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL\nTable 15.9: The random effects results for the wage equation\nTable 15.10: Hausman endogeneity test for the random effects wage model\nThe fixed effects model, however, does not allow time-invariant variables such as educ or black. Since the problem of the random effects model is endogeneity, one can use instrumental variables methods when time-invariant regressors must be in the model. The Hausman-Taylor estimator uses instrumental variables in a random effects model; it assumes four categories of regressors: time-varying exogenous, time-varying endogenous, time-invariant exogenous, and time-invariant endogenous. The number of time-varying variables must be at least equal to the number of time-invariant ones. In our wage model, suppose exper, tenure and union are time-varying exogenous, south is time-varying endogenous, black is time-invariant exogenous, and educ is timeinvariant endogenous. The same plm() function allows carrying out Hausman-Taylor estimation by setting model= ‚Äúht‚Äù.\nTable 15.11 shows the results of the Hausman-Taylor estimation, with the largest changes taking place for educ and black.\nTable 15.11: Hausman-Taylor estimates for the wage equation\nTable 15.12: The head of the grunfeld2 dataset organized as a panel\n15.5 Grunfeld‚Äôs Investment Example\nThe dataset grunfeld2 is a subset of the initial dataset; it includes two firms, GE and WE observed over the period 1935 to 1954. The purpose of this example is to identify various issues that should be taken into account when building a panel data econometric model.

THE LOGIT MODEL FOR BINARY CHOICE\nTable 16.2: Logit estimates for the ‚Äôcoke‚Äô dataset\nPrediction and marginal effects for the logit model can be determined using the same predict function as for the probit model, and Equation 16.8 for marginal effects.\nA useful measure of the predictive capability of a binary model is the number of cases correctly predicted. The following table (created by the above code lines) gives these numbers separated by the boinary choice values; the numbers have been determined by rounding the predicted probabilities from the logit model.\nThe usual functions for hypothesis testing, such as anova, coeftest, waldtest and linear.hypothesis are available for these models.\nHnull &lt;- ‚Äúdisp_coke+disp_pepsi=0‚Äù linearHypothesis(coke.logit, Hnull)\nThe above code tests the hypothesis that the effects of displaying coke and displaying Table 16.3: Three binary choice models for the ‚Äôcoke‚Äô dataset\nDependent variable:\nNote: ‚àóp&lt;0.1; ‚àó‚àóp&lt;0.05; ‚àó‚àó‚àóp&lt;0.01\nTable 16.4: Logit prediction results\n16.5.

Let us use the dataset nels_small for an example of how multinom works. The variable grades in this dataset is an index, with best grades represented by lower values of grade. We try to explain the choice of a secondary institution (psechoice) only by the high school grade. The variable pschoice can take one of three values:\npsechoice = 1 no college,\npsechoice = 2 two year college\npsechoice = 3 four year college\nlibrary(nnet)\ndata(‚Äúnels_small‚Äù, package=‚ÄúPoEdata‚Äù)\nnels.multinom &lt;- multinom(psechoice~grades, data=nels_small)"

Unlike in the multinomial logit model, the coefficient on the independent variable price is the same for all choices, but the value of the independent variable is different for each individual.\nR offers several alternatives that allow fitting conditional logit models, one of which is the function MCMCmnl() from the package MCMCpack (others are, for instance, clogit() in the survival package and mclogit() in the mclogit package).

    "text": "Wald-statistic: 243 on 4 Df, p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16\nThe following code lines calculate the marginal effect of education on hours for some given values of the regressors.\nThe calculated marginal effect is 26.606. (The function censReg() from package censReg can also be used for estimating Tobit models; this function gives the possibility of calculating marginal effects using the function margEff().)\n16.10 The Heckit, or Sample Selection Model\nThe models are useful when the sample selection is not random, but whehter an individual is in the sample depends on individual characteristics. For example, when studying wage determination for married women, some women are not in the labour force, therefore their wages are zero.\nThe model to use in such situation is Heckit, which involves two equations: the selection equation, given in Equation 16.15, and the linear equation of interest, as in Equation 16.16.\nEstimates of the Œ≤s can be obtained by using least squares on the model in Equation 16.17, where Œªi is calculated using the formula in Equation 16.18.\nŒ¶(Œ≥1 + Œ≥2wi)\nThe amount Œª given by Equation 16.18 is called the inverse Mills ratio.\nthe Heckit procedure involves two steps, estimating both the selection equation and the equation of interest. Function selection() in the sampleSelection package performs both steps; therefore, it needs both equations among its arguments. (The selection equation is, in fact, a probit model.)"
