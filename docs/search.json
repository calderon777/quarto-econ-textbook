This textbook guides students through applied lab sessions using R, combining data science, econometrics, and visual learning.\n📘 Navigate using the table of contents on the left.\n🔍 Each lab includes: - Practical exercises\n- R code\n- Embedded videos\n- Interactive charts (coming soon)\n\n“The best way to learn econometrics is to do it.” – You, probably\n\nEconometrics introduces quantitative methods for both qualitative and quantitative data analysis. The focus includes a variety of estimation methods for economic data with diverse structures and uses applied applications of these econometric methods to estimate empirical models. These techniques provide a foundation for the final-year dissertation project.\nData Analytics provides an applied framework for economists to understand economic decision-making and the formation of expectations and forecasting. Analytics follows a topic-based approach to forecasting techniques and automatisation to areas of study such as Economics, Environmental Economics, Capital Markets, and Financial Economics. The content also covers an introduction to the Trading room, this will allow the techniques to be contextualised to applied problems.\nThis handbook has been produced to provide students with specific information and guidance about their labs. The contents of this handbook are indicative, this means they can be updated or modified upon the review of the module leader (Cam).\nAn electronic version of this handbook (which is continuously updated) is available on the VLE system, which you should consult regularly as the main reference point throughout your studies.\nThe handbook is organised in 50 minutes chunks, sometimes active lectures, othertimes practical labs.\n\n\n2 App and Website Disclaimer\nFrom time to time this website may include links to other third party websites.

Install R and RStudio on your laptops/gadgets\nRStudio is a wrapper for R; we are using RStudio because it makes looks R more organised and straightforward. Follow the following instructions:\n\ngo to www.r-project.com\nclick on ‘CRAN mirror’\nchoose one of the two UK mirrors - https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/ or https://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/\nClick on ‘Download R for Windows’ or ‘Download R for macOS’\nClick on ’install R for the first time\nClick on ‘Download R-… for Windows’, the current version is R-4..5.1. Or alternatively, download the executable file for macOS.\ndouble-click the downloaded file, then click on ‘Run’, ‘language:English’, ‘OK’, and read and follow the instructions of installation until you click on ‘Next’ for installing and ‘Finish’\n\nThen proceed to Installing RStudio.\n\nGo to rstudio.com\nclick on ‘download’\ndownload the Free version, download RStudio for Windows or macOS\nClick on ‘Next’ if you agree and on ‘Install’ and ‘Finish’ to complete the process.\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Introduction to R\nLong Tutorial\nWe would cover a brief introduction on this labs, students would like to cover a longer tutorial to get use to R quickly. Click on this link: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf\nQuick tutorial - RStudio Screen\nYou need to have installed R and RStudio to continue with this lab.\n\nOpen Rstudio in your computer.\n\n\n\n\nOn this picture, there are three panels ‘the Console’, ‘The Environment’, and ‘The Plots, Help and Files’ panel.\n\n\n\nLet’s choose a better appeareance for our RStudio. Click on “Tools” and then “Global Options.”\n\n\n\n\nImage 5\n\n\n\nAfterwards, in the window “Options”, click on “Appearance”, RStudio theme: “Modern”, Editor font: “Courier”, Editor theme: Cobalt. Finally, click on “Apply”\n\n\n\n\nImage 6\n\n\n\nNow, we want to open a file to save the code that we are learning during this session. Click on ‘File’, ‘New File’, and ‘R Script’; or simply press Ctrl+Shift+N; this will open a new panel called ‘Script’ where we are going to write the commands for R. The name of the script is Untitled 1. At the end of this session save the script in a folder for this module.\n\n\n\n\nImage 7\n\n\nLet’s learn how to write our own comments in our R code/ script.\n\nOn the script panel, type the caracter # and then write ‘LAB ONE – ECON2545 – AND THE DATE TODAY’.\n\nR will ignore any line of command starting with #. You can use # to add comments, titles, reminders within your R code/ R Script.\n\n\n\nImage 8\n\n\nThe Rstudio screen has four windows or panels: 1. Console. 2. Environment and history. 3. Files, plots, packages and help. 4. The R script(s) and data view. The R script is where you keep a record of your work or commands - in a line by line basis. For Stata users this would be like the do-file, for SPSS users is like the syntax and for SAS users the SAS program.\n\nLet’s type ‘getwd()’ in line number ‘2’ and hit the keys ‘ctrl+enter’ in your keyboard at the same time. If you did this correctly you will see in the console panel the folder or working directory that R is using to download and upload data.\n\n\n\n\nImage 9\n\n\nLet’s create a folder in Windows for your course using File Explorer. I called my folder ‘R code – LABs’. Afterwards, in RStudio’ go to ‘Session’, ‘Set Working Directory’, and ‘Choose Directory’, afterwards, select the folder ‘R code – LABs’ or the name you used.\n\n\n\nImage 10\n\n\nThe above will result in code within the ‘Console’, the code is setwd(and a path/directory to the folder in your computer). Copy and paste that in your R code; next time you will only need to hit ‘ctrl+enter’ to set the directory or folder where you are going to work in R.\n\n\n\nImage 11\n\n\n\nCopy and paste the outcome of you console in your R code; next time you will only need to hit ‘ctrl’ and ‘enter’ to set working directory.\n\n\n\n\nImage 12\n\n\n\nIn line number 4, type 5*5 and hit ‘ctrl’ and ‘enter’, the console will show the code and the result, 25.\nLet’s create a matrix; use the lines 5 and 6 in your script and hit ‘ctrl’ & ‘enter’ to line 5 and then 6.\n\n\n\n\nImage 13\n\n\nIf you did it correctly, the outcome in the console will be as follows:\n\n\n\nImage 14\n\n\n\nIn the line 5, you asked R to create a matrix called ‘A’, with numbers from 1 to 8, with four rows and two columns.\n\nHave a look at the ‘Environment’ panel, you can see in there all active objects(e.g. matrix A), and the panel ‘History’ shows a list of commands used do far.\n\n\n\nImage 15\n\n\n\nTo see the matrix A in a new window, type the command View(A) in line 7 and hit the keys ‘ctrl+ enter’ to run line 7. Afterwards, come back to your R script ‘Untitled 1’.\n\n\n\n\nImage 16\n\n\nPackages tab\nThe package tab shows the list of add-ons included in the installation of RStudio. If checked, the package is loaded into R, if not, any command related to that package won’t work, you will need select it. You can also install other add-ons by clicking on the ‘Install Packages’ icon.\nAnother way to install add-ons is to type the command install.packages(“name of the package”), and then you will be able to open the library of commands of that package.\n\nIn line 8, to install the package forecast, type install.packages(“forecast”) and hit ctrl+enter. In the next window, you can hit yes to restart RStudio. See the picture below, you shall not get errors in the console, and at the end, the sign ‘&gt;’ will let you know the instalation run OK.\n\n\n\n\nImage 17\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 You must activate the package by typing, for example, library(forecast). This will automatically check the ‘forecast’ package.\n\n\n\nImage 18\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 19\n\n\n\n\n2.5.4 We will use the package forecast in this course to analyse and predict economic time series.\n\n\n2.5.5 Do not forget to save your R script in your own course folder! Use the icon to save, I called my file “lab001” and now is available , folder ‘R code – LABs’\n\n\n\nImage 20",

Here’s a brief overview:\n\n\n2.12.21 Basic Plotting:\nFunction: plot() Usage: To plot data points and lines. Arguments: x, y: Variables to be plotted. xlab, ylab: Labels for x and y-axis. type: Determines the style of the plot. Options include: “p”: Points only “l”: Lines only “b”: Both points and lines “n”: No plot, creates an empty graph. Useful as a foundation for other plot elements.\n\n\n2.12.22 Plotting Mathematical Curves:\nFunction: curve() Usage: To plot a curve based on a mathematical function over a specified range. Example: Key Argument: “add”: If set to TRUE, the curve is added to an existing graph.\n\ncurve(x^1, from=-2, to=2, xlab=\"x\", ylab=\"y = x\" ) # Add another curve to the existing graph:*\ncurve(x^2, add = TRUE) #plot(1:100, type='n')*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncurve(sqrt(x), from=0, to=100, xlab=\"x\", ylab=\"y\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.12.23 Adding Lines:\nFunction: abline() Usage: To add lines defined by specific parameters to a graph. Arguments: a, b: Defines a line based on its intercept (a) and slope (b). h: Specifies the y-value for drawing a horizontal line. v: the x-value for drawing a vertical line. x-value for a vertical line; coef, the name of a simple linear regression object, which includes the intercept and slope of a regression line.\n\nplot(1:10, type=\"n\") # creates an empty graph\nabline(a=8, b=-0.5, h=3.5, v=4) # Add straight lines to graph \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncurve(x^2, from=0, to=20) \nabline(v=10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of using the function abline()",

Activity 1. As a registered student on the ECON2545 module you should have received an email from Refinitiv that gives you your user ID (should be your DMU email address) and a link for you to access Refinitiv workspace as in Figure 1 below (Fig. 1). If you do not seem to have received this email then please check your junk and/or spam folders. If you still think that you have not received the email then please contact me by email to let me know Please be aware that ‘Refinitiv Workspace’ is compatible with Google Chrome and Apple Safari. If you are on a Microsoft Windows computer please download Chrome to your device if you do not use it already. You may need to make it your default browser for the purposes of setting up Refinitiv Eikon after which you can reset back to your usual default browser, remembering that you will need to use Chrome whenever using Refinitv Eikon.\n\n\n\nImage 48\n\n\n\n\n\nImage 49\n\n\n\nActivity 2. You will be taken to Chrome to set up a password to use with your ID as in Fig. 2 below.

Most of these are only a couple of minutes long. The first time that you click on a video you will be asked to sign in with your DMU EMAIL ADDRESS. The training videos will enhance your ability to use the software and will, therefore, directly impact upon your ability to manage your presentation** assignment**** and final examination**. However, I recommend that once you have signed in, you go to Activity 11 to view the videos as part of the user ‘Certification’ process rather than doing them as a standalone exercise. Fig. 16\n\n\n\nImage 73\n\n\nActivity 11. Refinitiv also has a user ‘Certification’ qualification. This can be accessed from the menu bar as shown in Fig.18. Fig. 18\n\n\n\nImage 74\n\n\nFig. 19\n\n\n\nImage 75\n\n\nThe ‘Certification’ screen, as shown in Fig.19, gives details on how to complete the certificate. In brief, to obtain certification status, you must complete training videos and e-learning modules and then pass a 60-minute test including 30 multiple-choice questions. You will need to select the Eikon Product Certification (Fig 19.) and this will take you to the required Learning Materials. Students must begin to complete the Refinitiv Workspace certification during the lab. Not only will this help students for their assessment, but it will also enhance their** CV****s**** for presentation to potential employers. Fig.19 Activity 12. Continue to work through the Refinitv Eikon training materials and explore the software as part of your self-study. The quicker you become familiar with using the software, the easier you will find our labs throughout the academic year.

All shops selling non-essential goods are told to close, gatherings of more than two people in public are banned, events including weddings - but excluding funerals - are cancelled.\n10 May: Mr Johnson announces the first easing of England’s lockdown, telling people they are allowed to sunbathe in parks and leave the house to exercise more than once a day. He says England may be in a position “to begin the phased reopening of shops” and get primary pupils back to school in steps staggered by year groups “at the earliest by 1 June”.\n1 June: Lockdown measures are eased, with school children in England in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 returning to the classroom.\n15 June: England’s retail parks, high streets and shopping centres welcome customers, while zoos and safari parks open their doors for the first time since March. Places of worship reopen for private prayer while some secondary school pupils have begun returning to their classrooms.\n16 June: The cheap steroid dexamethasone is hailed as a major breakthrough as a study suggests it is the first drug to reduce deaths from coronavirus.\n28 August: Those facilitating or organising illegal raves, unlicensed music events, or any other unlawful gathering of more than 30 people may now face a £10,000 fine, as tougher measures come into force before the bank holiday weekend.\n11 September: The R value of coronavirus transmission across the UK rises above 1 for the first time since early March, according to government advisers, with the estimate between 1.0 and 1.2.\n18 September: Mr Johnson warns that a second wave of coronavirus has arrived in the UK. Sage estimates the R number - representing the number of people an infected person will pass the virus to - at between 1.1 and 1.4, meaning cases could rise very quickly.Parts of England’s North West, West Yorkshire and the Midlands face tough new restrictions in response to “major increases” in cases.\n21 September: Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick tells a televised briefing the UK could see 50,000 cases a day by mid-October and a daily death toll of 200 or more a month later unless urgent action is taken.\n22 September: The prime minister announces new restrictions, including a 10pm curfew on pubs, bars and restaurants in England from 24 September, while face coverings are made mandatory in more scenarios and limits for weddings and receptions are cut to 15 people maximum. Scotland and Northern Ireland deviate from the restrictions in place for England by announcing bans on households mixing indoors, while Wales includes a ban on alcohol sales in off-licences and supermarkets after 10pm in addition to the curfew on hospitality venues.\n24 September: New regulations (SI 1029) come into force, in part, at 5 am in England, prohibiting certain ′restricted businesses′ and ′restricted services′ from carrying on that business or providing that service between the hours of 22:00 and 05:00. The regulations affect a wide range of establishments, including restaurants, bars, public houses, social clubs, casinos, bingo halls, bowling alleys, cinemas, theatres, concert halls, amusement arcades, funfairs (indoors or outdoors), theme parks and adventure parks. The protected area of Bolton is excluded from the scope of this legislation as additional restrictions apply\n27 September: The Labour Party urges the government to pause the return of university students as thousands self-isolate due to COVID-19 outbreaks, but the return is defended by Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who says clear guidelines are in place for universities. David Lammy, the Shadow Secretary of State for Justice, expresses concern that 10pm pub curfews have led to drinkers continuing to socialise afterwards, with them “hanging around towns” and “potentially spreading the virus”.\n2 October: Around a quarter of the population of the United Kingdom, about 16.8 million people, are now in local lockdowns. This includes 23% of people in England, 76% of people in Wales and 32% of people in Scotland\n14 October: The new three-tier system of restrictions for England, taking effect from 14 October. Areas are grouped into one of three risk categories – medium, high, or very high. Medium areas are subject to the rule of six and the 10pm curfew, high areas have restrictions on indoor meetings but groups of six can continue to meet in outdoor settings, and very high areas will see the closure of businesses such as pubs and casinos, but not restaurants. The Liverpool City Region is the only area to be placed in the very high category\n31 October: After scientists project that there could be several thousand COVID deaths a day, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announces a second lockdown for England, for four weeks from Thursday 5 November to Wednesday 2 December, in order to prevent what he describes as a “medical and moral disaster” for the NHS. England will then revert back to the tier system.\n\n\n29 We add vertical lines with the command abline\nabline(v =4, col=“red”)\nabline(v =6, col=“blue”)\n\n\n30 there are three events in June, we only use one vertical line\nabline(v =7, col=“blue”)\nabline(v =9, col=“red”)\nabline(v =10, col=“red”)\nWas covid a hoax?\nGoing forward, what timelines makes sense to make the partitions of the data to forecast?\nPerform a 12 months forecast using seasonal naïve forecast; what would be the beast ?\n\n\n31 install the package forecast if you have not done so previously.\ninstall.packages(“forecast”)\n#open the library forecast\nlibrary(forecast)\n\n\n32 create the object snaive.edeaths to keep in there the snaive estimation\n\n\n33 by visualisation I used a 10 months frequency in the waves on this data\n#h=6 as the excercise asks for a 6 monts forecast\nsnaive.edeaths &lt;- snaive(ts(edeaths$excess, frequency = 10), h=12)\nplot(snaive.edeaths)\nTo what extend the excess deaths decreased using the first wave of covid and the last fourth wave?\nExcess deaths decreased 83,17%\nWhat are the maximum deaths in the new calculation?\nAround 34,881 excess deaths.\nCreate two horizontal lines, one for zero (2015-19 average), and the second for the peak of the last death wave.\nIf excess deaths cross that threshold there might be a new lockdown?\nDo we anticipate a lockdown this Christmas?\nHow many excess deaths register the dataset in the first 12 months?\n325,624\nHow many casualties the model forecast in 12 months? Is this the new normal?\nThe same number of the previous 12 months, 196,080.\nWhat could be an appropriate date to perform a partition?\nThe troughts of the waves\nWhy were the data partitioned?\nThe validation partition provides a benchmark against which to test predictions, which is important because the goal of this effort is to forecast future excess deaths in the context of covid and backlogs in the treatment of other health issues.\nWhy did the analyst choose 12 months for the validation period?\nThe forecast horizon is monthly forecasts for 1-12 months ahead. Choosing 12 months for the validation partition allows evaluating the prediction accuracy of 12-month ahead forecasts. A choice of a longer validation period might have been avoided to include recent data in the training period.\nWhat is the naive forecast for the validation period? (assume that you must provide forecasts for 12 months ahead)\nBecause there is seasonality in the series (waves), the naïve forecast for each of the months in the validation period is equal to an estimation of the duration of the wave, ceteris-paribus of other variables that can shorten or increase the length of the wave.\nCompute the RMSE and MAPE for the naive forecasts.\nRMSE =\nMAPE =\n\n33.0.0.0.0.1 partition of the data and forecast\n\n\n\n34 we define the data as time series and generated our first time series graph\nedeaths.ts &lt;- ts(edeaths$excess, start = c(2019,12), end = c(2022, 10), freq = 12)\nplot(edeaths.ts, xlab = “Date”, ylab = “weekly excess deaths per month”, main = “UK Excess Deaths”)\nstepsAhead &lt;- 9\nnTrain &lt;- length(edeaths.ts) - stepsAhead\ntrain.ts &lt;- window(edeaths.ts, start = c(2019, 12), end = c(2019,nTrain+12), freq=12)\nlines(train.ts, col=“blue”)\nvalid.ts &lt;- window(edeaths.ts, start = c(2019, nTrain + 13), end = c(2019, 12+nTrain + stepsAhead), freq=12)\nlines(valid.ts, col =“red”)\n\n\n35 This is the command for the naive forecast, I am creating the variable ‘naive4cast’, which is going\n\n\n36 to capture the results for the naive forecast in the training period.\nsnaive4cast&lt;-snaive(train.ts, h= 9)\n\n\n37 We forecast using the training period\nforecast(snaive4cast, h=9)\n\n\n38 We find level of accuracy, we will cover this during the next lecture\naccuracy(snaive4cast,valid.ts)\nplot(snaive4cast)\nlines(valid.ts)\n\n\n39 We create a histogram of the residuals/errors/ random error\nhist(snaive4cast$residuals, ylab = “Frequency”, xlab = “Forecast Error”, bty = “l”, main = ““)\nPlot a histogram of the forecast errors that result from the naive forecasts (for the validation period). Plot also a time plot for the naive forecasts and the actual sales numbers in the validation period. What can you say about the behavior of the naive forecasts?\nThe naïve forecasts are under-predictions of actual sales. This can be seen in both plots.\nThe analyst found a forecasting model that gives satisfactory performance on the validation set. What must she do to use the forecasting model for generating forecasts for year 2002?\nThe training and validation periods must be re-combined, and then the forecasting model should be applied to the complete series before producing future forecasts. (we did this at the beginning of this lab)\nLab 8 – Refinitiv: KEYST, ECOW, COUN, WEI / API: Connecting R to Bloomberg\nREFINITIV/EIKON – end of cross asset commands\nActivity 1. Key Stats  - what is the best gold mine to invest?\nThe KeyStats page allows users to compare a maximum of three different securities and to compare them across different valuation methods. In the Eikon Toolbar, search and choose the three securities to compare: Fresnillo, Centamin, and Polymetal. Search the meaning of the indicators and discuss what could be the best gold miner from this selection of companies.\nREFINITIV/EIKON – Forex commands\nExplore the following:\n\nFXBUZZ\n\nBloomberg\nActivity 3. finding datasets for assignments\nThere is a very wide array of information available on Bloomberg. Information can typically be split into country, industry or company information. This information sheet does not cover all of the detailed information which you may need, but should act as a signpost for where to find the information you need.\nCOUNTRY-LEVEL INFORMATION\nECOW  provides economic information of a wide variety, over a number of years, such that changes can also be observed. Select the appropriate country, and depending on the source information for that country, up to 200 different data items may be available, including GDP, CPI, unemployment, housing market data, retail sector data, exports, imports and exchange rates\nCOUN  has 4 different tabs providing country information and charts, under the headings ‘financial’, ‘economic’, ‘risk’ and ‘profile’ which includes country officials and information about main exports for example.\nWEI  provides information about World Equity Indices and a snapshot of gains/losses in the indices.\nFFM to find case studies written by Bloomberg specialists.\nHit the key  on the function screen to access its instructions, definitions, documents and further information.\nActivity 3. Using Bloomberg From R and Excel\nBloomberg from R\nFirst, you need to be logged on to Bloomberg.\nIf the Bloomberg/Excel add-in does not work, then: 1. Close Excel and/or R 2. Keep Bloomberg running 3. Go to Start-&gt; Bloomberg -&gt; API Environment Diagnostics 4. Click Start when the Bloomberg API Diagnostics window has loaded 5. If a “Login to wintrv…” message below then pops up, this occurs when Bloomberg isn’t open – it is highly recommended that you have Bloomberg running; you can proceed without it, but you may not be able to resolve some errors if you do so 6. Once the check is finished, you will get a ‘Diagnostics completed’ message 7. If the Repair button is available to press on the Bloomberg API Diagnostics window, it means it needs to run the repair and you should do so by clicking Repair (it should take a couple of minutes) 8. Once the check is done, and repair if necessary, the ideal state is all green ticks except for 2 yellow “!” for Dotnet Installation and Excel Throttle Interval only. Else, you can still run Excel or R-Studio and see if the Bloomberg-associated functionality is working.\n\n\n40 install the Bloomberg package, and connect\ninstall.packages(“Rblpapi”)\nlibrary (Rblpapi)\nblpConnect()\n\n\n41 get the Bloomberg data history for SPY US Equity - last 100 days - and plot it\nx &lt;- bdh(“SPY US Equity”, “PX_LAST”, start.date=Sys.Date()-100)\nplot(x)\n\n\n42 find out what other fields are available for prices\nres &lt;- fieldSearch(“price”)\nres\n\n\n43 get the Bloomberg data history for SPY US Equity - last 100 days - and plot it\nx &lt;- bdh(“SPY US Equity”, “OPEN”, start.date=Sys.Date()-100) plot(x)\nBloomberg from Excel\nAs above, if the Bloomberg/Excel add-in does not work, then repair (Steps 1-8).\nOpen an Excel Sheet, and type the following into a cell:\nHistorical prices: BDH(“F US Equity”, “PX_LAST”, “16/11/2000”, “15/11/2016”); this will give you the last traded price (PX_LAST) for ’F US Equity (Ford Motor Company) from 16/11/2000 to 15/11/2016. The first parameter must be the Bloomberg stock code.\nFor DMU students, this shows how to get data from Bloomberg into Excel. Also for DMU students, this shows how to use Bloomberg.\nLab 9 – API: Getting data from Refinitiv using R script.\nUploading data from Refinitiv into R\nThere is a big community of developers and users for both R and Refinitiv. Students can visit the forums and ask questions to fix their codes. We will install the eikonapir package; more information about this package can be found at:\nActivity 1. Type APPKEY in the Eikon/Refinitiv search box.\nActivity 2. Type your name, tick all check the boxes, and click on Register New App.\nActivity 3. Read the Term and Conditions. Users/students must not share your App Key for Eikon/Refinitiv.\nActivity 4. Copy your App Key using right-click with your mouse.\nActivity 5. Paste the App key in the following code in R. You must open RStudio and write the following code within a Rscript\ninstall.packages(“devtools”)\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(“ahmedmohamedali/eikonapir”)\nlibrary(eikonapir)\neikonapir:: set_proxy_port(9000L)\neikonapir:: set_app_id(“Type your app key here”)\nresult &lt;- get_symbology (list(“MSFT.O”, “GOOG.O”, “IBM.N”), “RIC”, list(“ISIN”),\nraw_output=FALSE, debug=FALSE)\nprint(result)\nActivity 6. Run the code line by line using ctrl+enter (command +enter for MAC).\nUsers need to install packages only the first time and update the packages from time to time. Users must open the libraries in line 3 and 5 (devtools and eikonapir) every time they use this rutine. Look carefully at each line and ask questions to your tutor if required.\nActivity 7. Making a reference list of assets’ identifiers in a dataframe.\nYou can use this to find identifiers for datasets you are searching.\nThis is the outcome:\nActivity 8. Get the last price, volume and lower price for IBM, Google, and Microsoft:\nActivity 9. Get the number of employees and profit for IBM\nActivity 10. Getting time series for MMM and III.L; this is 3M and 3i shares.\nYou can investigate these businesses in the search box of Refinitiv are.\nReview the dataset for both shares with the command View in RStudio.\nActivity 11. Download yearly GDP for Italy, and quarterly CPI for Australia.\nActivity 12. Forecast five years (20 quarters) of CPI for Australia using moving averages and trailing moving averages (lecture for week 8).\nYou can inspect the file “lab9.R” available in bb. What is the extend of the inflation/deflation assuming the pandemic never happened?\nLab 10 – Exponential Forecasting\nACTIVITY 1 - Impact of the pandemic on visitors to the UK\nTask 1- Find the publication ‘Overseas Travel and Tourism:2020’ on the ONS website and compare the release with the ‘Travel Trends in 2019’. What is the most popular reason to visit the UK? And why the trend change abruptly in 2020?\nTask 2 - Search the ‘overseas visitors to the UK’ in Refinitiv; alternatively, you can find the mnemotechnic ‘aGBTOURARR/A’\nTask 3 – Review the previous lab 9; using APPKEY in Refinitiv and the library eikonapir in R, get the time series for ‘aGBTOURARR/A’ since the year 2000.\nTask 4 – Performe some data management, convert aGBTOURARR/A to a numeric format (if the format is ‘character’) and set the series as a data frame in R.\nTask 5 – Open the library ‘forecast’ and ‘zoo’; what are these libraries for? Type ‘?forecast’ and ‘?zoo’ in the console without the quotes.\nTask 6 – Set the dataset as a timeseries and plot the data.\nTask 7 - perform double differencing on the data and plot the results. What is the effect on the data? Plot the double-differenced data.\nTask 8 – Perform a partition of the data with a validation period equal to 36 months.\nTask 9 - Perform a simple exponential forecast with additive errors and nothing for the trend and the seasonal component. Plot the results and compute the indicators of accuracy.\nTask 10 – repeat the procedure, this time do not use the double-differenced series, use the original data set and calculate the best Holt’s specification (Explain the Holt’s method discussed during the lecture). Show the accuracy measures and plot the forecasts.\nForecast with double-differencing\nForecast with the original data\nWhat is the best forecasting technique for this data? Double-differencing or forecast with the original data?\nACTIVITY 2 - Forecasting Department store sales; CH5, problem 5, p110-112.\nThe figure above is a time plot of the seasonally adjusted pre-September-11 Air series. Which of the following smoothing methods would be adequate for forecasting this series?\nNaive forecasts\nMoving average (with what window width?)\nSimple exponential smoothing\nDouble exponential smoothing\nHolt-Winter’s exponential smoothing\nNote that the seasonally-adjusted series still contains a trend, and hence double exponential smoothing is needed.\nLab 11 – MCQs assessment\nMCQs, weight 20%, deadline Dec 6, 2023 during the Lab sessions. Group 1: 11-12 noon, Group 2: 2-3 PM. The assessment for group 2 is from 2-3 PM to accomodate a guest speaking session.",

You have learnt how to forecast the future with Linear regression; now use the dataset for your assessment (presentation).\nVideo 2: Lab 17 Confusion Matrix, Melbourne rainfall forecast, what are odds of an event happening?\nThis week we covered during the lecture binary forecasts using logistic regression. This technique will help you to forecast binary events, e.g. is your team going to win or not, is there going to be a recession again this year or not, is certain share going to increase greatly its price or not, etc. The basic idea is to forecast the probability of certain event happening. We will use 0 when the event occurs and 1 when it does not occur.\nActivity 1. Confusion Matrix\nTask1. The following table shows the typical outcome of a confusion matrix using R. Suppose a 2x2 table with the notation ‘Reference’ for your binary dependent variable (e.g. recession or not recession), and the notation ‘Predicted’ for your forecast. The confusion matrix shows how many times the estimated model perform well in the green sections of the table; contrary, the red sections are the number of mistakes of your prediction model/forecasts.\nRead the documentation about confusionatrix for R. Find and read the section ‘Details’ in the following link: . The link will explain the outcome of the confusion matrix in R.\nTask 2. Download in your appropriate datasets folder the file ‘MelbourneRainfall.xls’ from the folder “Data Sets” in bb. Afterwards, run the following code:",

    "text": "120.54 \nUnderstanding the Confusion Matrix\nA confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It summarizes the number of correct and incorrect predictions, comparing the actual values with the model’s predictions. It’s particularly useful for understanding the performance of a model in binary classification tasks.\nThe key terms in a confusion matrix are:\nTrue Positives (TP): Correctly predicted positive observations.\nTrue Negatives (TN): Correctly predicted negative observations.\nFalse Positives (FP): Incorrectly predicted positive observations (Type I error).\nFalse Negatives (FN): Incorrectly predicted negative observations (Type II error).\nKey Points to Discuss\nAccuracy: This is the proportion of total correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) out of all predictions. It’s a good measure when the classes are balanced but can be misleading when dealing with imbalanced classes.\nSensitivity (Recall): This indicates how well the model is at predicting positive class. High sensitivity means the model is good at catching positives but might also have more false positives.\nSpecificity: This is about identifying negatives. A high specificity means the model is good at avoiding false positives but might miss some positives (false negatives).\nPrecision (Positive Predictive Value): This tells you how many of the positive predictions were actually positive.\nNegative Predictive Value: This is about the proportion of negatives that were correctly identified.\nBalance Between Sensitivity and Specificity: Ideally, a model should have a good balance between sensitivity and specificity. However, depending on the application, you might prefer one over the other (e.g., in medical diagnostics, high sensitivity might be preferred).\nDifferences Between Training and Validation Results: It’s essential to compare the performance on the training set and the validation set to check for overfitting. If a model performs significantly better on the training set than on the validation set, it might be overfitted.\nLab 16: Neural Networks I\nCam Calderon\n2023-12-12\nNEURAL NETS",

In my youtube channel, I produced one example using European GDP; for future reference, you can review .\nACTIVITY ONE – Retail Sales\nTask1. The retail sector is without doubts one of the most affected sectors during the pandemic; your first task is to read the latest report from ONS,\nTask 2. Go to the folder ‘R Code’ in bb and download and open the file ‘Models with trend and seasonality. I wrote this R code for the excel file ‘ONS retail.xls’, the excel file is available in the folder ‘Data sets’ in bb, you shall also download the excel file and place the file any folder such as ‘Documents’; note we created a default working directory for econ2545 on a previous lab.\nRun the entire code and check line by line to understand what you are doing, if you have questions about any line in the code, ask your lecturer during the session.\nTask 2. The excel file Retails sales is outdated, and it would be fantastic to analyse the retail sales as this sector is very important for the UK economy. You must update the excel file using the ONS website or Refinitiv. Section 7, on the ONS link above, contains data for non seasonally adjusted retail sales, which could be better as we would like to forecast with seasonality.\nTask 3. Know that you know how to adapt the R code to new data, its time to use the dataset you will use for your first assessment (presentation 40%). Adapt the code and ask questions to your lecturer if needed.\nLab 15- Foreign Exchange Rate Market\nActivity 1. FX Top of Book\nTask 1. In the Eikon Toolbar, search .\nTask 2. Press the icon settings in order to add new profiles (groups of currencies) or different currencies into a group.\nActivity 2. Currency Performance/ Value Tracker\nUsing the Currency Performance/ Value Tracker application, users can compare how a specific currency performed historically and currently. While the 3 months implied volatility implies the market’s sentiments on the currency pair currently, the 3 months realised volatility is the traded volatility 3 months ago. Hence, comparing the two figures could be beneficial to an options buyer as to whether they should buy or sell an option right now.\nTask 1. In the Eikon Toolbar, search \nFor example, Here, the 3M implied volatility for USDCAD is 6.75 while the 3M realised volatility is 6.57. Hence the currency pair USDCAD is currently more volatile as compared to 3M ago.\nHave a look at the current volatiliries, what is the most volatile currency pair using both implied and realised volatility?\nACTIVITY 3. FX Polls / FX forecast\nTask1. Type FX Polls or FX Forecast in the application Search box located on the top left of your screen.\nYou can also access FX Polls by going to Refinitiv Icon next to the search box and Click &gt; Markets &gt; FX Overview Guide, and clicking the FX Polls link available in the MARKET TOOLS area.\nTask 2. Choose one of the forecast contributors and check the box ‘Show Historical Poll Data’. In your opinion, what is the best forecaster for EURUSD?\nActivity 4. Calculating GBPUSD autocorrelation\nTask 1. Get the time series in R.\n\n152.4.0.1 API\n#install.packages(“devtools”)\nlibrary(devtools)\n#install_github(“ahmedmohamedali/eikonapir”, force=TRUE)\nlibrary(eikonapir)\neikonapir::set_proxy_port(9000L)\neikonapir::set_app_id(‘your Refinitiv Key - APPKEY’)\ngbp &lt;- get_timeseries(“GBP=”,\nstart_date = “2013-01-01T01:00:00”,\nend_date= paste0(Sys.Date(), “T01:00:00”),\nraw_output = FALSE, interval = “monthly”)\nstr(gbp)\ngbp.n &lt;- as.numeric(gbp$‘CLOSE’)\ngbp.df &lt;-as.data.frame(gbp.n)\nView(gbp.df)\nTask 2.

The contents of this handbook are indicative, this means they can be updated or modified upon the review of the module leader (Cam).\nAn electronic version of this handbook (which is continuously updated) is available on the VLE system, Blackboard, which you should consult regularly as the main reference point throughout your studies.\nIndicative Contents\nPrerequisite 6\nLecture 1 - The Simple Linear Regression Model 7\nLecture 2 - Prediction with the Linear Regression Model 15\nVideo 1 - Using Indicator Variables in a Regression & Monte Carlo 23\nVideo 2 -Interval Estimation 28\nLab 1 – Hypothesis Test, P-Value and Testing Linear Combination of Parameters 35\nLab 2 -The p-Value 40\nLab 3 - Prediction, R-squared, and Modelling 45\nLab 4 Linear-Log Models 52\nLab 5- Polynomial Models 59\nLab 6 – Hands-on on your assignment 68\nPrerequisite\nReview the assignment brief for the report assessment and download an appropriate dataset.\nStudents will adapt the R scripts of the next three weeks of labs to the dataset and topic of the report.\nLecture 1 - The Simple Linear Regression Model\nNote: students must adapt the following R scrips to their assignment 2 (report) using an appropriate dataset.\nSummary: in simple linear regression, we use one independent variable to predict a dependent variable. The relationship is represented by a straight line with an intercept and a slope.\nIntroduction: In this lecture, we will explore the fundamentals of the Simple Linear Regression Model, a statistical method used to understand the relationship between two variables. This model is foundational for understanding more complex statistical analyses in your future studies.\nKey terms: A dependent variable, represented as ‘y’, is what we aim to predict, while an independent variable, denoted as ‘x’, is the variable(s) we use to explain y. Imagine predicting a student’s final grade (y) based on their hours of study (x). Here, the final grade depends on, or is predicted by, the hours of study.\nThe General Model\nThe model assumes a linear relationship between the conditional expectation of a dependent variable, y, and an independent variable, x. Independent variable sometimes are called ‘response’ or ‘response variable’, and the independent variables ‘regressors.’ The assumed relationship has the form:\nyi = β1 + β2xi + ei, (1)\nwhere\ny is the dependent variable\nx is the independent variable\ne is an error term\nσ2 is the variance of the error term\nβ1 is the intercept parameter or coefficient\nβ2 is the slope parameter or coefficient\ni stands fot the i -th observation in the dataset, i = 1,2,…,N\nN is the number of observations in the dataset\nFigure: Example of several observations for any given x\nThe predicted, or estimated value of y given x is given by the following equation; in general, the hat symbol indicates an estimated or a predicted value.\nyˆ = b1 + b2x (2)\nThe model assumes that the values of x are previously chosen (therefore, they are non-random), that the variance of the error term, σ2, is the same for all values of x, and that there is no connection between one observation and another (no correlation between the error terms of two observations). In addition, it is assumed that the expected value of the error term for any value of x is zero.\nThe subscript i in Equation 1 indicates that the relationship applies to each of the N observations. Thus, there must be specific values of y, x, and e for each observation. However, since x is not random, there are, typically, several observations sharing the same x, as the scatter diagram in Figure above shows.\nExample: Food Expenditure versus Income\nThe data for this example is stored in the R package PoEdata (To check if the package PoEdata is installed, look in the Packages list.)\nlibrary(PoEdata)\ndata(food)\nhead(food)\nIt is always a good idea to visually inspect the data in a scatter diagram, which can be created using the function plot(). Figure 2.2 is a scatter diagram of food expenditure on income, suggesting that there is a positive relationship between income and food expenditure.\ndata(“food”, package=“PoEdata”)\nplot(food\\(income, food\\)food_exp, ylim=c(0, max(food\\(food_exp)), xlim=c(0, max(food\\)income)), xlab=“weekly income in $100”, ylab=“weekly food expenditure in $”, type = “p”)\nEstimating a Linear Regression\nThe R function for estimating a linear regression model is lm(y~x, data) which, used just by itself does not show any output; It is useful to give the model a name, such as mod1, then show the results using summary(mod1). If you are interested in only some of the results of the regression, such as the estimated coefficients, you can retrieve them using specific functions, such as the function coef(). For the food expenditure data, the regression model will be\nfood_exp = β1 + β2income + e (3)\nwhere the subscript i has been omitted for simplicity.\nFigure: A scatter diagram for the food expenditure model\nlibrary(PoEdata)\nmod1 &lt;- lm(food_exp ~ income, data = food)\nb1 &lt;- coef(mod1)[[1]]\nb2 &lt;- coef(mod1)[[2]]\nsmod1 &lt;- summary(mod1)\nsmod1",

All we need to do is to plug the estimated parameter values and the given income into an equation like Equation (2). For example, the expected value of food_exp for an income of $2000 is calculated in Equation (4) below. (Remember to divide the income by 100, since the data for the variable income is in hundreds of dollars.)\n\n\n\nR does this calculations for us with its function called predict(). Extending the example to more than one income, say income = $2000, $2500, and $2700. The function predict() in\nR requires that the new values of the independent variables be organized under a particular form, called a data frame. In R, a set of numbers is held together using the structure c(). The following sequence shows this example.",

For instance, if the elasticity of price with respect to sqft is 0.5, a 1% increase in sqft leads to a 0.5% increase in price. if the elasticity is less than 1, it suggests that changes in sqft have a proportionally smaller effect on price, which might imply that other factors are also important in determining the price. unlike linear models, in non-linear models, elasticity can change at different levels of the independent variable.\nDraw a scatter diagram and see how the quadratic function fits the data. The next chunk of code provides two alternatives for constructing such a graph. The first simply draws the quadratic function on the scatter diagram, using the R function curve(); the second uses the function lines, which requires ordering the dataset in increasing values of sqft before the regression model is evaluated, such that the resulting fitted values will also come out in the same order.\nmod31 &lt;- lm(price~I(sqft^2), data=br)\nplot(br\\(sqft, br\\)price, xlab=“Total square feet”, ylab=“Sale price, $”, col=“grey”)\n#add the quadratic curve to the scatter plot:\ncurve(b1+b2*x^2, col=“red”, add=TRUE)\nAn alternative way to draw the fitted curve:\nFigure: A comparison between the histograms of ’price‘ and ’log(price)‘\nThe log-linear model regresses the log of the dependent variable on a linear expression of the independent variable (unless otherwise specified, the log notation stands for natural logarithm, following a usual convention in economics):\nlog(yi) = β1 + β2xi + ei (6)\nOne of the reasons to use the log of an independent variable is to make its distribution closer to the normal distribution. Let us draw the histograms of price and log(price) to compare them (see last Figure above). It can be noticed that that the log is closer to the normal distribution.\nhist(br$price, col=‘grey’)\nhist(log(br$price), col=‘grey’)\nWe are interested, as before, in the estimates of the coefficients and their interpretation, in the fitted values of price, and in the marginal effect of an increase in sqft on price.\nThe coefficients are b1 = 10.84 and b2 = 0.00041, showing that an increase in the surface area (sqft) of an apartment by one unit (1 sqft) increases the price of the apartment by 0.041 percent. Thus, for a house price of $100,000, an increase of 100 sqft will increase the price by approximately 100 ∗ 0.041 percent, which is equal to $4112.7. In general, the marginal effect of an increase in x on y in Equation 6 is\nand the elasticity is\nThe next lines of code show how to draw the fitted values curve of the loglinear model and how to calculate the marginal effect and the elasticity for the median price in the dataset.

The procedure requires three elements: the hypotheses (the null and the alternative), a test statistic, which in the case of the simple linear regression parameters is the t-ratio, and a significance level, α.\nSuppose we believe that there is a significant relationship between a household’s income and its expenditure on food, a conjecture which has led us to formulate the food expenditure model in the first place. Thus, we believe that β2, the (population) parameter, is different from zero. Equation 5 shows the null and alternative hypotheses for such a test.\n\n\n\nIn general, if a null hypothesis H0 : βk = c is true, the t statistic (the t-ratio) is given by Equation 6 and has a t distribution with N − 2 degrees of freedom.\n\n\n\nTest the hypothesis in Equation 5, which makes c = 0 in Equation 6.

In our\n4.3. LINEAR-LOG MODELS\nTable 4.1: Output generated by the ’anova‘ function\nsimple regression model, the sum of squares due to regression only includes the variable income. In multiple regression models, which are models with more than one independent variable, the sum of squares due to regression is equal to the sum of squares due to all independent variables. The anova results in Table 4.1 include other useful information: the number of degrees of freedom, anov[2,1] and the estimated variance σˆ 2 =anov[2,3].\nLab 4 Linear-Log Models\nNon-linear functional forms of regression models are useful when the relationship between two variables seems to be more complex than the linear one. One can decide to use a non-linear functional form based on a mathematical model, reasoning, or simply inspecting a scatter plot of the data. In the food expenditure model, for example, it is reasonable to believe that the amount spent on food increases faster at lower incomes than at higher incomes. In other words, it increases at a decreasing rate, which makes the regression curve flatten out at higher incomes.\nWhat function could one use to model such a relationship? The logarithmic function fits this profile and, as it turns out, it is relatively easy to interpret, which makes it very popular in econometric models. The general form of a linear-log econometric model is provided in Equation 4.7.\nyi = β1 + β2log(xi) + ei (4.7)\nThe marginal effect of a change in x on y is the slope of the regression curve and is given by Equation 4.8; unlike in the linear form, it depends on x and it is, therefore, only valid for small changes in x.\ndy β2\n= (4.8) dx x\nRelated to the linear-log model, another measure of interest in economics is the semi-elasticity of y with respect to x, which is given by Equation 4.9. Semi-elasticity suggests that a change in x of 1% changes y by β2/100 units of y. Since semi-elasticity also changes when x changes, it should only be determined for small changes in x.\nTable 4.2: Linear-log model output for the food example\ndy = (%∆x) (4.9)\nAnother quantity that might be of interest is the elasticity of y with respect to x, which is given by Equation 4.10 and indicates that a one percent increase in x produces a (β2/y) percent change in y.\nβ2\n%∆y = (%∆x) (4.10)\ny\nLet us estimate a linear-log model for the food dataset, draw the regression curve, and calculate the marginal effects for some given values of the dependent variable.\nmod2 &lt;- lm(food_exp~log(income), data=food)\ntbl &lt;- data.frame(xtable(mod2)) kable(tbl, digits=5, caption=“Linear-log model output for the food example”)\nThe results for an income of $1000 are as follows: dy/dx = 13.217, which indicates that an increase in income of $100 (i.e., one unit of x) increases expenditure by $\n4.4. RESIDUALS AND DIAGNOSTICS\nFigure 4.3: Linear-log representation for the food data\n13.217; for a 1% increase in income, that is, an increase of $10, expenditure increases by $ 1.322; and, finally, for a 1% increase in income expenditure incrases by 0.638%.\n4.4 Residuals and Diagnostics\nRegression results are reliable only to the extent to which the underlying assumptions are met. Plotting the residuals and calculating certain test statistics help deciding whether assumptions such as homoskedasticity, serial correlation, and normality of the errors are not violated. In R, the residuals are stored in the vector residuals of the regression output.\nehat &lt;- mod2\\(residuals plot(food\\)income, ehat, xlab=“income”, ylab=“residuals”)\nFigure 4.4 shows the residuals of the of the linear-log equation of the food expenditure example. One can notice that the spread of the residuals seems to be higher at higher incomes, which may indicate that the heteroskedasticity assumption is violated.\nLet us draw a residual plot generated with a simulated model that satisfies the regression assumptions. The data generating process is given by Equation 4.11, where x is a number between 0 and 10, randomly drawn from a uniform distribution, and the error term is randomly drawn from a standard normal distribution. Figure\nFigure 4.4: Residual plot for the food linear-log model 4.5 illustrates this simulated example.\nyi = 1 + xi + ei, i = 1,…,N (4.11)\nset.seed(12345) #sets the seed for the random number generator x &lt;- runif(300, 0, 10) e &lt;- rnorm(300, 0, 1) y &lt;- 1+x+e mod3 &lt;- lm(y~x) ehat &lt;- resid(mod3) plot(x,ehat, xlab=“x”, ylab=“residuals”)\nThe next example illustrates how the residuals look like when a linear functional form is used when the true relationship is, in fact, quadratic. The data generating equation is given in Equation 4.12, where x is the same uniformly distributed between −2.5 and 2.5), and e ∼ N(0,4). Figure 4.6 shows the residuals from estimating an incorrectly specified, linear econometric model when the correct specification should be quadratic.\nyi = 15 − 4x2i + ei, i = 1,…,N (4.12)\n4.4. RESIDUALS AND DIAGNOSTICS\nFigure 4.5: Residuals generated by a simulated regression model that satisfies the regression assumptions\nAnother assumption that we would like to test is the normality of the residuals, which assures reliable hypothesis testing and confidence intervals even in small samples. This assumption can be assessed by inspecting a histogram of the residuals, as well as performing a Jarque-Bera test, for which the null hypothesis is “Series is normally distributed”. Thus, a small p-value rejects the null hypothesis, which means the series fails the normality test. The Jarque-Bera test requires installing and loading the package tseries in R. Figure 4.7 shows a histogram and a superimposed normal distribution for the linear food expenditure model.\nFigure 4.6: Simulated quadratic residuals from an incorrectly specified econometric model\njarque.bera.test(ehat) #(in package ‘tseries’)",

POLYNOMIAL MODELS\nFigure 4.7: Histogram of residuals from the food linear model\nLab 5- Polynomial Models\nRegression models may include quadratic or cubic terms to better describe the nature of the dadta. The following is an example of quadratic and cubic model for the wa_wheat dataset, which gives annual wheat yield in tonnes per hectare in\nGreenough Shire in Western Australia over a period of 48 years. The linear model is given in Equation 4.13, where the subscript t indicates the observation period.\nyieldt = β1 + β2timet + et (4.13)\nFigure 4.8 shows a pattern in the residuals generated by the linear model, which may inspire us to think of a more appropriate functional form, such as the one in Equation 4.14.\nyieldt = β1 + β2time3t + et (4.14)\nFigure 4.8: Residuals from the linear wheatyield model\nPlease note in the following code sequence the use of the function I(), which is needed in R when an independent variable is transformed by mathematical operators. You do not need the operator I() when an independent variable is transformed through a function such as log(x). In our example, the transformation requiring the use of I() is raising time to the power of 3. Of course, you can create a new variable, x3=xˆ3 if you wish to avoid the use of I() in a regression equation.\nmod2 &lt;- lm(wa_wheat$greenough~I(time^3), data=wa_wheat)\nehat &lt;- resid(mod2) plot(wa_wheat$time, ehat, xlab=“time”, ylab=“residuals”)\nFigure 4.9 displays a much better image of the residuals than Figure 4.8, since the residuals are more evenly spread about the zero line.\n4.6 Log-Linear Models\nTransforming the dependent variable with the log() function is useful when the variable has a skewed distribution, which is in general the case with amounts that cannot be negative. The log() transformation often makes the distribution closer to normal. The general log-linear model is given in Equation 4.15.\n4.6. LOG-LINEAR MODELS\nFigure 4.9: Residuals from the cubic wheatyield model\nlog(yi) = β1 + β2xi + ei (4.15)\nThe following formulas are easily derived from the log-linear Equation 4.15. The semi-elasticity has here a different interpretation than the one in the linear-log model: here, an increase in x by one unit (of x) produces a change of 100b2 percent in y. For small changes in x, the amount 100b2 in the log-linear model can also be interpreted as the growth rate in y (corresponding to a unit increase in x). For instance, if x is time, then 100b2 is the growth rate in y per unit of time.\nPrediction: yˆn = exp(b1 + b2x), or yˆc = exp(b1 + b2x + σˆ22), with the “natural” predictor yˆn to be used in small samples and the “corrected” predictor, yˆc, in large samples\nMarginal effect (slope): dxdy = b2y\nSemi-elasticity: %∆y = 100b2∆x\nLet us do these calculations first for the yield equation using the wa_wheat dataset.\nTable 4.3 gives b2 = 0.017844, which indicates that the rate of growth in wheat Table 4.3: Log-linear model for the yield equation\nTable 4.4: Log-linear ’wage’ regression output\nproduction has increased at an average rate of approximately 1.78 percent per year.\nThe wage log-linear equation provides another example of calculating a growth rate, but this time the independent variable is not time, but education. The predictions and the slope are calculated for educ = 12 years.\nHere are the results of these calculations: “natural” prediction yˆn = 14.796; corrected prediction, yˆc = 16.996; growth rate g = 9.041; and marginal effect dxdy = 1.34. The growth rate indicates that an increase in education by one unit (see the data description using ?cps4_small) increases hourly wage by 9.041 percent.\nFigure 4.10 presents the “natural” and the “corrected” regression lines for the wage equation, together with the actual data points.\neducation=seq(0,22,2) yn &lt;- exp(b1+b2education) yc &lt;- exp(b1+b2education+sighat2/2)\n4.6. LOG-LINEAR MODELS\nFigure 4.10: The ’normal’ and ’corrected’ regression lines in the log-linear wage equation\nplot(cps4_small\\(educ, cps4_small\\)wage, xlab=“education”, ylab=“wage”, col=“grey”) lines(yn~education, lty=2, col=“black”) lines(yc~education, lty=1, col=“blue”) legend(“topleft”, legend=c(“yc”,“yn”), lty=c(1,2), col=c(“blue”,“black”))\nThe regular R2 cannot be used to compare two regression models having different dependent variables such as a linear-log and a log-linear models; when such a comparison is needed, one can use the general R2, which is Rg2 = [corr(y,yˆ]2. Let us calculate the generalized R2 for the quadratic and the log-linear wage models.\nrg5 &lt;- cor(cps4_small$wage,yhat5)^2\nThe quadratic model yields Rg2 = 0.188, and the log-linear model yields Rg2 = 0.186; since the former is higher, we conclude that the quadratic model is a better fit to the data than the log-linear one. (However, other tests of how the two models meet the assumptions of linear refgression may reach a different conclusion; R2 is only one of the model selection criteria.)\nTo determne a forecast interval estimate in the log-linear model, we first construct the interval in logs using the natural predictor yˆn, then take antilogs of the interval limits. The forecasting error is the same as before, given in Equation 4.4. The following calculations use an education level equal to 12 and α = 0.05.\nThe result is the confidence interval (5.26, 41.62). Figure 4.11 shows a 95% confidence band for the log-linear wage model.\n4.7. THE LOG-LOG MODEL\nFigure 4.11: Confidence band for the log-linear wage equation\n4.7 The Log-Log Model\nThe log-log model has the desirable property that the coefficient of the independent variable is equal to the (constant) elasticity of y with respect to x. Therefore, this model is often used to estimate supply and demand equations. Its standard form is given in Equation 4.16, where y, x, and e are N × 1 vectors.\nlog(y) = β1 + β2log(x) + e (4.16)\nTable 4.5: The log-log poultry regression equation\nTable 4.5 gives the log-log regression output. The coefficient on p indicates that an increase in price by 1% changes the quantity demanded by −1.121%.",

Thus, the interpretation of a slope parameter has to take into account possible changes in other independent variables: a slope parameter, say βk, gives the change in the dependent variable, y, when the independent variable xk increases by one unit while all the other independent variables remain constant. Equation 5.1 gives the general form of a multiple regression model, where y, xk, and e are N × 1 vectors, N is the number of observations in the sample, and k = 1,…,K indicates the k-th independent variable. The notation used in Equation 5.1 implies that the first independent variable, x1, is an N × 1 vector of 1s.\ny = β1 + β2x2 + … + βKxK + e (5.1)\nTable 5.1: Summary statistics for dataset andy\nThe model assumptions remain the same, with the additional requirement that no independent variable is a linear combination of the others.\n5.2 Example: Big Andy’s Hamburger Sales\nThe andy dataset includes variables sales, which is monthly revenue to the company in $1000s, price, which is a price index of all products sold by Big Andy’s, and advert, the advertising expenditure in a given month, in $1000s. Summary statistics for the andy dataset is shown in Table 5.1. The basic andy model is presented in Equation 5.2.\nsales = β1 + β2price + β3advert + e (5.2)\nTable 5.2 shows that, for any given (but fixed) value of advertising expenditure, an increase in price by $1 decreases sales by $7908. On the other hand, for any given price, sales increase by $1863 when advertising expenditures increase by $1000.\neffprice &lt;- effect(“price”, mod1)\nplot(effprice)\nsummary(effprice)\nTable 5.2: The basic multiple regression model\nFigure 5.1: The partial effect of price in the basic andy regression",

In more complex functional forms, the R function effect() plots the partial effect of a variable for given levels of the other independent variables in the model. The simplest possible call of this function requires, as arguments, the name of the term for which we wish the partial effect (in our example price), and the object (model) in question. If not otherwise specified, the confidence intervals (band) are determined for a 95% confidence level and the other variables at their means. A simple use of the effects package is presented in Figure 5.2, which plots the partial effects of all variables in the basic andy model.

I chose to insert the I(advertˆ2) term to indicate that the variable of interest needs to be specified exactly as it appears in the model.\nAll the methods available in R for simple linear regression models are available for multiple models as well. Thus, to extract the information generated by the lm() function, we use the similar code as before. As we have already learned, the command ?mod1 gives a list with all the information stored in the mod1 object. The next code sequence illustrates how to access various regression output items for the basic andy equation.\nFigure 5.3: An example of using the function ’effect’ in a quadratic model\nThe covariance matrix, or the variance-covariance matrix shown in Table 5.3 contains all the estimated variances and covariances of the regression coefficients. These are useful when testing hypotheses about individual coefficients or combinations of those.\nTable 5.3: The coefficient covariance matrix\n5.3 Interval Estimation in Multiple Regression\nInterval estimation is similar with the one we have studied in the simple regression model, except the number of degrees of freedom is now N − K, where K is the number of regression coefficients to be estimated. In the andy example, df = 72 and the variances and covariances of the estimates are given in the following code sequence.\nWith the calculated standard error of b2, se(b2) = 1.096, we can now determine a 95% confidence interval, as shown in the following code lines. The code also shows using the R function confint(model, parm, level) to check our results.\nalpha &lt;- 0.05\ntcr &lt;- qt(1-alpha/2, df)\nlowb2 &lt;- b2-tcr*seb2\nupb2 &lt;- b2+tcr*seb2\nlowb3 &lt;- b3-tcr*seb3\nupb3 &lt;- b3+tcr*seb3\nconfints &lt;- confint(mod1, parm=c(“price”, “advert”), level=0.95)\nkable(data.frame(confints),caption=“Confidence intervals for ‘price’ and ‘advert’”, align=“c”, col.names=c(“lowb”, “upb”), digits=4)\nFinding an interval estimate for a linear combination of the parameters is often needed. Suppose one is interested in determining an interval estimate for sales when the price decreases by 40 cents and the advertising expenditure increases by $800 (see Equation 5.3) in the andy basic equation.\nTable 5.4: Confidence intervals for ’price’ and ’advert’\nλ = 0β1 − 0.4β2 + 0.8β3 (5.3)\nThe calculated confidence interval is (3.471,5.836). Let us calculate the variance of a linear combination of regression parameters in a more general way to take advantage of R’s excellent capabilities of working with complex data structures such as lists, vectors, and matrices. This code sequence introduces a few new elements, such as matrix transposition and multiplication, as well as turning a list into a vector. The matrix multiplication operator in R is %*% and the transposition operator is t().\nLecture 2 - Hypothesis Testing in Multiple Regression\nThe process of testing hypotheses about a single parameter is similar to the one we’ve seen in simple regression, the only difference consisting in the number of degrees of freedom. As an example, let us test the significance of β2 of the basic andy equation. The hypotheses are given in Equation 5.4.\nH0 : β2 = 0, HA : β2 ≠ 0 (5.4)\nalpha &lt;- 0.05\ndf &lt;- mod1$df.residual\ntcr &lt;- qt(1-alpha/2, df)\nb2 &lt;- coef(mod1)[[“price”]]\nseb2 &lt;- sqrt(vcov(mod1)[2,2])\nt &lt;- b2/seb2\nThe calculated t is equal to −7.215, which is less than −tcr = −1.993, indicating that the null hypothesis is rejected and that β2 is significantly different from zero.\nAs usual, we can perform the same test using the p-value instead of tcr.\nt &lt;- b2/seb2\npval &lt;- 2*(1-pt(abs(t), df)) #two-tail test\nThe calculated p-value is 4.423999 × 10−10. Since this is less than α we reject, again, the null hypothesis H0 : β2 = 0. Let us do the same for β3:\nalpha &lt;- 0.05\ndf &lt;- mod1$df.residual\ntcr &lt;- qt(1-alpha/2, df)\nb3 &lt;- coef(mod1)[[3]]\nseb3 &lt;- sqrt(vcov(mod1)[3,3])\ntval &lt;- b3/seb3\nCalculated t = 2.726, and tcr = 1.993. Since t &gt; tcr we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between advert and sales. The same result can be obtained using the p-value method:\npval &lt;- 2*(1-pt(abs(tval), df))\nResult: p-value = 0.008038 &lt; α. R shows the two-tail t and p values for coefficients in regression output (see Table 5.2).\nA one-tail hypothesis testing can give us information about price elasitcity of demand in the basic andy equation in Table 5.2. Let us test the hypothesis described in Equation 5.5 at a 5% significance level. The calculated value of t is the same, but tcr corresponds now not to but to α.\nH0 : β2 ≥ 0, HA : β2 &lt; 0 (5.5)\nThe results t = −7.215, tcr = −1.666 show that the calculated t falls in the (left-tail) rejection region. The p-value, which is equal to 2.211999 × 10−10, is less than α, also rejects the null hypothesis.\nHere is how the p-values should be calculated, depending on the type of test:\nTwo-tail test (HA : β2 6= 0), p-value &lt;- 2*(1-pt(abs(t), df))\nLeft-tail test (HA : β2 &lt; 0), p-value &lt;- pt(t, df)\nRight-tail test (HA : β2 &gt; 0), p-value &lt;- 1-pt(t, df)\nAnother example of a one-tail hypothesis testing is to test whether an increase of $1 in advertising expenditure increases revenue by more than $1. In the hypothesis testing language, we need to test the hypothesis presented in Equation 5.6.\nH0 : β3 ≤ 1, HA : β3 &gt; 1 (5.6)\ntval &lt;- (b3-1)/seb3\npval &lt;- 1-pt(tval,df)\nThe calculated p-value is 0.105408, which is greater than α, showing that we cannot reject the null hypothesis H0 : β3 ≤ 1 at α = 0.05. In other words, increasing advertising expenditure by $1 may or may not increase sales by more than $1.\nTesting hypotheses for linear combinations of coefficients resembles the interval estimation procedure. Suppose we wish to determine if lowering the price by 20 cents increases sales more than would an increase in advertising expenditure by $500. The hypothesis to test this conjecture is given in Equation 5.7.\nH0 : 0β1 − 0.2β2 − 0.5β3 ≤ 0, HA : 0β1 − 0.2β2 − 0.5β3 &gt; 0 (5.7)\nLet us practice the matrix form of testing this hypotesis. R functions having names that start with as. coerce a certain structure into another, such as a named list into a vector (names are removed and only numbers remain).\nThe answer is p-value= 0.054619, which barely fails to reject the null hypothesis. Thus, the conjecture that a decrease in price by 20 cents is more effective than an increase in advertising by $800 is not supported by the data.\nFor two-tail linear hypotheses, R has a built-in function, linearHypothesis(model, hypothesis), in the package car. This function tests hypotheses based not on t-statistics as we have done so far, but based on an F-statistic. However, the p-value criterion to reject or not the null hypothesis is the same: reject if p-value is less than α. Let us use this function to test the two-tail hypothesis similar to the one given in Equation 5.7. (Note that the linearHypothesis() function can test not only one hypothesis, but a set of simultaneous hypotheses.)\nhypothesis &lt;- “-0.2price = 0.5advert”\ntest &lt;- linearHypothesis (mod1, hypothesis)\nFstat &lt;- test$F[2]\npval &lt;- 1-pf(Fstat, 1, df)\nThe calculated p-value is 0.109238, which shows that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. There are a few new elements, besides the use of the linearHypothesis function in this code sequence. First, the linearHypothesis() function creates an R object that contains several items, one of which is the F-statistic we are looking for. This object is shown in Table 5.5 and it is named test in our code. The code element test$F[2] extracts the F-statistic from the linearHypothesis() object.\nSecond, please note that the F-statistic has two ‘degrees of freedom’ parameters, not only one as the t-statistic does. The first degree of freedom is equal to the number of simultaneous hypotheses to be tested (in our case only one); the second is the number of degrees of freedom in the model, df = N − K.\nLast, the function that calculates the p-value is pf(Fval, df1, df2), where Fval is the calculated value of the F-statistic, and df1 and df2 are the two degrees of freedom parameters of the F-statistic.\nkable(test, caption=“The linearHypothesis() object”)\nTable 5.5: The ’linearHypothesis()‘ object\nTable 5.6: The quadratic version of the andy model\n5.5 Polynomial Regression Models\nA polynomial multivariate regression model may include several independent variables at various powers. In such models, the partial (or marginal) effect of a regressor xk on the response y is determined by the partial derivative ∂x∂yk. Let us consider again the basic andy model with the added advert quadratic term as presented in Equation 5.8.\nsalesi = β1 + β2pricei + β3adverti + β4advert2i + ei (5.8)\nAs we have noticed before, the quadratic term is introduced into the model using the function I() to indicate the presence of a mathematical operator. Table 5.6 presents a summary of the regression output from the model described in Equation 5.8.\nLet us calculate the marginal effect of advert on sales for two levels of advert; the relevant partial derivative is the one in Equation 5.9.\n(5.9)\nadvlevels &lt;- c(0.5, 2)\nb3 &lt;- coef(mod2)[[3]]\nb4 &lt;- coef(mod2)[[4]]\nDsDa &lt;- b3+b4*advlevels\nThe calculated marginal effects for the two levels of advertising expenditure are, respectively, 10.767254 and 6.615309, which shows, as expected, diminishing returns to advertising at any given price.\nOften, marginal effects or other quantities are non-linear functions of the parameters of a regression model. The delta method allows calculating the variance of such quantities using a Taylor series approximation. This method is, howver, valid only in a vicinity of a point, as any mathematical object involving derivatives.\nSuppose we wish to test a hypothesis such as the one in Equation 5.10, where c is a constant.\nH0 : g(β1,β2) = c (5.10)\nThe delta method consists in estimating the variance of the function g(β1,β2) around some given data point, using the formula in Equation 5.11, where gi stands for calculated at the point β = b.\nvar(g) = g12var(b1) + g22var(b2) + 2g1g2cov(b1,b2) (5.11)\nLet us apply this method to find a confidence interval for the optimal level of advertising in the andy quadratic equation, g, which is given by Equation 5.12.\n(5.12)\nEquation 5.13 shows the derivatives of function g.\n(5.13)\nThe point estimate of the optimal advertising level is 2.014, with its confidence interval (1.758, 2.271).\nVideo 1 - Interaction Terms in Linear Regression\nInteraction terms in a regression model combine two or more variables and model interdependences among the variables. In such models, the slope of one variable may depend on another variable. Partial effects are calculated as partial derivatives, similar to the polynomial equations we have already studied, considering the interaction term a a product of the variables involved.\nReal-world relationships are often not simply additive and can depend on multiple factors simultaneously.\nFor example, the effect of exercise on health might depend on one’s diet, illustrating that both factors together influence the outcome more intricately than separately.\nPotential pitfalls of ignoring interaction terms are biased estimates or overlooked relationships.\nThe data file pizza4 includes 40 observations on an individual’s age and his or her spending on pizza. It is natural to believe that there is some connection between a person’s age and her pizza purchases, but also that this effect may depend on the person’s income. Equation 5.14 combines age and income in an interaction term, while Equation 5.15 shows the marginal effect of age on the expected pizza purchases.\npizza = β1 + β2age + β3income + β4(age × income) + e (5.14)\n(5.15)\nLet us calculate the marginal effect of age on pizza for two levels of income, $25000 and $90000. There are two ways to introduce interaction terms in R; first, with a : (colon) symbol, when only the interaction term is created; second, with the * (star) symbol when all the terms involving the variables in the interaction term should be\npresent in the regression. For instance, the code x ∗ z creates three terms: x, z, and x : z (this last one is x ‘interacted’ with z, which is a peculiarity of the R system).\ndata(“pizza4”,package=“PoEdata”)\nmod3 &lt;- lm(pizza~age*income, data=pizza4)\nsummary(mod3)",

    "text": "7.35 [1] -6.05841 -14.06896\nThe marginal effect of age is a reduction in pizza expenditure by $6.058407 for an income of $25000 and by $14.068965 for an income of $90000.\nEquation 5.16 is another example of a model involving an interaction term: the wage equation. The equation involves, besides the interaction term, logs of the response (dependent) variable is in logs and a quadratic term.\nlog(wage) = β1 + β2educ + β3exper + β4(educ × exper) + β5exper2 + e (5.16)\nTable 5.7: Wage equation with interaction and quadratic terms\nThe marginal effect of an extra year of experience is determined, again, by the partial derivative of log(wage) with respect to exper, as Equation 5.17 shows. Here, however, the marginal effect is easier expressed in percentage change, rather than in units of wage.\n(5.17)\nPlease note that the marginal effect of exper depends on both education and experience. Let us calculate this marginal effect for the average values of educ and exper.\nThe result of this calculation is %∆wage = −1.698, which has, apparently, the wrong sign. What could be the cause? Let us look at a summary of the regression output and identify the terms (see Table 5.7).\nkable(smod4, caption=“Wage equation with interaction and quadratic terms”)\nThe output table shows that the order of the terms in the regression equation is not the same as in Equation 5.16, which is the effect of using the compact term educ∗exper in the R code. This places the proper interaction term, educ : exper in the last position of all terms containing any of the variables involved in the combined term educ∗exper. There are a few ways to solve this issue. One is to write the equation code in full, without the shortcut educ ∗ exper; another is to use the names of the terms when retrieving the coefficients, such as b4 &lt;- coef(mod1)[[“I(experˆ2)”]]; another to change the position of the terms in Equation 5.16 according to Table 5.7 and re-calculate the derivative in Equation 5.17. I am going to use the names of the variables, as they appear in Table 5.7, but I also change the names of the parameters to avoid confusion.\nTable 5.8: Anova table for the basic andy model\nThe new result indicates that the expected wage increases by 0.68829 percent when experience increases by one year, which, at least, has the “right” sign.\n5.7 Goodness-of-Fit in Multiple Regression\nThe coefficient of determination, R2, has the same formula (Equation 5.18)and interpretation as in the case of the simple regression model.\n(5.18)\nAs we have already seen, the R function anova() provides a decomposition of the total sum of squares, showing by how much each predictor contributes to the reduction in the residual sum of squares. Let us look at the basic andy model described in Equation 5.2.\nTable 5.8 shows that price has the largest contribution to the reduction of variablity in the residuals; since total sum of squares is SST = 3115.482 (equal to the sum of column Sum.Sq in Table 5.8), the portion explained by price is 1219.091, the one explained by advert is 177.448, and the portion still remaining in the residuals is SSE = 1718.943. The portion of variability explained by regression is equal to the sum of the first two items in the Sum.Sq column of the anova table, those corresponding to price and advert: SSR = 1396.539.\nRStudio displays the values of all named variables in the Environment window (the NE panel of your screen). Please check, for instance, that R2 (named Rsq in the previous code sequence) is equal to 0.448.\nVideo 2 - Further Inference in Multiple Regression\nNew package: broom (Robinson 2016).\n6.1 Joint Hypotheses and the F-statistic\nA joint hypothesis is a set of relationships among regression parameters, relationships that need to be simultaneously true according to the null hypothesis. Joint hypotheses can be tested using the F-statistic that we have already met. Its formula is given by Equation 6.1. The F-statistic has an F distribution with the degrees of freedom J and N − K.\n(6.1)\nIn Equation 6.1 the subscript U stands for “unrestricted,” that is, the initial regression equation; the “restricted” equation is a new equation, obtained from the initial one, with the relationships in the null hypothesis assumed to hold. For example, if the initial equation is Equation 6.2 and the null hypothesis is Equation 6.3, then the restricted equation is Equation 6.4.\nThe symbol J in the F formula (Equation 6.1) is the first (numerator) degrees of freedom of the F statistic and is equal to the number of simultaneous restrictions in the null hypothesis (Equation 6.3); the second (the denominator) degrees of freedom of the F-statistic is N −K, which is the usual degrees of freedom of the unrestricted regression model (Equation 6.2). The practical procedure to test a joint hypothesis like the one in Equation 6.3 is to estimate the two regressions (unrestricted and restricted) and to calculate the F-statistic.\n6.2 Testing Simultaneous Hypotheses\nLet’s look, again, at the quadratic form of the andy equation (Equation 6.5).\nsales = β1 + β2price + β3advert + β4advert2 + e (6.5)\nEquation 6.5 has two terms that involve the regressor advert, of which at least one needs to be significant for a relationship between advert and sales to be established. To test if such a relationship exists, we can formulate the following test:\nH0 : β3 = 0 AND β4 = 0; HA : β3 ≠ 0 OR β4 ≠ 0 (6.6)\nI have already mentioned that R can do an F test quite easily (remember the function linearHypothesis?), but for learning purposes let us calculate the F-statistic in steps. The next code sequence uses information in the anova-type object, which, remember, can be visualized simply by typing the name of the object in the RStudio’s Console window.\nalpha &lt;- 0.05\ndata(“andy”, package=“PoEdata”)\nN &lt;- NROW(andy) #Number of observations in dataset\nK &lt;- 4 #Four Betas in the unrestricted model\nJ &lt;- 2 #Because Ho has two restrictions\nfcr &lt;- qf(1-alpha, J, N-K)\nmod1 &lt;- lm(sales~price+advert+I(advert^2), data=andy)\nanov &lt;- anova(mod1) anov # prints ‘anova’ table for the unrestricted model\nThe calculated F-statistic is fval = 8.441 and the critical value corresponding to a significance level α = 0.05 is 3.126, which rejects the null hypothesis that both β3 and β4 are zero. The p-value of the test is p = 0.0005.\nUsing the linearHypothesis() function should produce the same result:\nHnull &lt;- c(“advert=0”, “I(advert^2)=0”)\nlinearHypothesis(mod1,Hnull)\nThe table generated by the linearHypothesis() function shows the same values of the F-statistic and p-value that we have calculated before, as well as the residual sum of squares for the restricted and unrestricted models. Please note how I formulate the joint hypothesis as a vector of character values in which the names of the variables perfectly match those in the unrestricted model.\nTesting the overall significance of a model amounts to testing the joint hypothesis that all the slope coefficients are zero. R does automatically this test and the resulting F-statistic and p-value are reported in the regression output.\nsummary(mod1)",

However, one-tail tests, single or joint cannot be easily performed by an F test.\nLet us solve one more exercise involving a joint hypothesis with linear combinations of regression coefficients. Suppose we want to test the simultaneous hypotheses that the monthly advertising expenditure advert0 = $1900 in the quadratic andy model (Equation 6.5) satisfies the profit-maximizing condition β3 + 2β4advert0 = 1 , and that, when price = $6 and advert = $1900 sales revenue is $80000.\nTable 6.4 includes the F-statistic of the test, F = 5.741229 and its p-value p = 0.004885. Please be aware that the function tidy changes the names in the output of linearHypothesis. A useful exercise is to compare the raw output of linearHypothesis with the output generated by tidy(linearHypothesis(mod1)). There are several other possibilities to compare two regression models, such as a restricted and unrestricted ones in R, such as the anova() function or Wald tests.\nThese are going to be mentioned in later chapters.\nLab 1 - Omitted Variable Bias\nConsider the general model with two regressors in Equation 6.7, a model that I will call the true model.\ny = β1 + β2x2 + β3x3 + e (6.7)\nSuppose we are only interested in estimating β2, but there is no data available for x3, or for other reasons x3 is omitted from the model in Equation 6.7. What is the error in the estimate of β2 introduced by omitting x3? Equation 6.8 shows what is left of the true model after omitting x3.\nTable 6.5: The correct model\ny = β1 + β2x2 + u (6.8)\nLet b∗2 be the estimate of β2 when x3 is omitted. Equation 6.9 gives the bias in this simple, two-regressor case. The formula shows that bias depends on the direct relationship between the omitted regressor and response through β3, as well as the correlation between the omitted and the included regressors. When β3 and cov(x2, x3) are both positive or both negative the bias is positive (the incorrect model overestimates the true β2), and when they are of opposite signs the bias is negative (β2 is underestimated)\n(6.9)\nThe example in this section uses the dataset edu_inc, and two models: one where the response variable family income (faminc) is explained by the regressors husband’s education (he) and wife’s education (we), and another model, where the we regressor is omitted. The purpose is to compare the estimates coming from the two models and see if there is a significant difference between them.\ndata(“edu_inc”, package=“PoEdata”)\nmod1 &lt;- lm(faminc~he+we, data=edu_inc)\nmod2 &lt;- lm(faminc~he, data=edu_inc)\nkable(tidy(mod1), caption=“The correct model”)\nkable(tidy(mod2), caption=“The incorrect model (‘we’ omitted)”)\nThe marginal effect of husband’s education is much lower in the incorrect model. Let us apply the logic of Equation 6.9 to the edu_inc model. The direct effect of the omitted regressor (we) on response (faminc) is likely to be positive in theory (higher education generates higher income); the correlation between husband’s and wife’s education is also likely to be positive if we believe that people generally marry persons within their entourage. Thus, we should expect that omitting the regressor we should produce an overestimated marginal effect of he. Our data happen to confirm this supposition, though there is some chance that they might not.\nTable 6.6: The incorrect model (’we’ omitted)\nTable 6.7: Correct ’faminc’ model\nUnderstanding the problem of omitted variable is very important because it can justify the choice of a particular model. If one is not interested in the effect of variable x3 on y and can convince that x3 is uncorrelated with x2, one can argue with criticism about omitting the important regressor x3.\n6.4 Irrelevant Variables\nWe have seen the effect of omitting a relevant regressor (the effect is biased estimates and lower variances of the included regressors). But what happens if irrelevant variables are incorrectly included? Not surprisingly, this increases the variances (lowers the precision) of the other variables in the model. The next example uses the same (edu_inc) dataset as above, but includes two artificially generated variables, xtra_x5 and xtra_x6 that are correlated with he and we but, obviously, have no role in determining y. Let us compare two models, of which one includes these irrelevant variables.\nmod3 &lt;- lm(faminc~he+we+kl6, data=edu_inc) mod4 &lt;- lm(faminc~he+we+kl6+xtra_x5+xtra_x6, data=edu_inc) kable(tidy(mod3), caption=“Correct ‘faminc’ model”)\nkable(tidy(mod4),\ncaption=“Incorrect ‘faminc’ with irrelevant variables”)\nTable 6.8: Incorrect ’faminc’ with irrelevant variables\nA comparison of the two models shown in Tables 6.7 and 6.8 indicates that the inclusion of the two irrelevant variables has increased the marginal effects, standard errors, and the p-values of he and we. Thus, including irrelevant variables may incorrectly diminish the significance of the “true” regressors.\n6.5 Model Selection Criteria\nThe main tools of building a model should be economic theory, sound reasoning based on economic principles, and making sure that the model satisfies the Gauss-Markov assumptions. One should also consider the possibility of omitted variable bias and the exclusion of irrelevant variables that may increase variablility in the estimates. After all these aspects have been considered and a model established, there are a few quantities that help comparing different models. These are R2, adjusted R2 (R¯2), the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and the Schwarz (or Bayesian information) criterion (SC or BIC).\nWe have already seen how to calculate the coefficient of determination, R2 and how it measures the distance between the regression line and the observation points. A major disadvantage of R2 is that it increases every time a new regressor is included in the model, whether the regressor is relevant or not. The idea of counterbalancing this property of R2 has lead to a new measure, adjusted R2, denoted by R¯2, given by Equation 6.10.\n(6.10)\nAdjusted R2, while addressing the problem with R2, introduces other problems. In general, no single goodness of fit measure is perfect. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Schwarz criterion use the same idea of penalizing the introduction of extra regressors. Their formulas are given in Equations 6.11 and 6.12.\n(6.11)\n(6.12)\nAmong several models, the best fit is the one that maximizes R2 or R¯2. On the contrary, the best model must minimize AIC or BIC. Some computer packages, R included, calculate AIC and BIC differently than Equations 6.11 and 6.12 indicate. However, the ranking of the various models is the same.\nThe following code sequence needs some explanation. Function as.numeric extracts only the numbers from an object such as glance(mod1), which also contains row and column names. The purpose is to put together a table with information comming from several models. Function rbind gathers several rows in a matrix, which then is made into a data.frame and given the name tab. The part of code [,c(1,2,8,9)] at the end of rbind instructs R to pick all rows, but only columns 1, 2, 8, and 9 from the glance table. Function row.names assigns or changes the row names in a data frame; finally, kable, which we have already encountered several times, prints the table, assigns column names, and gives a caption to the table. While there are many ways to create a table in R, I use kable from package knitr because it allows me to cross-reference tables within this book. kable only works with data frames.\nTable 6.9 shows the four model selection criteria for four different models based on the edu_inc dataset, with the first column showing the variables included in each model. It is noticeable that three of the criteria indicate the third model as the best fit, while one, namely R2 prefers the model that includes the irrelevant variables xtra_x5 and xtra_x6.\nTable 6.9: Model comparison, ’faminc’\nAs a side note, a quick way of extracting the information criteria from an lm() object is illustrated in the following code fragment.\nlibrary(stats)\nsmod1 &lt;- summary(mod1)\nRsq &lt;- smod1$r.squared\nAdjRsq &lt;- smod1$adj.r.squared\naic &lt;- AIC(mod1)\nbic &lt;- BIC(mod1)\nc(Rsq, AdjRsq, aic, bic)",

This method automatically adds higher-order polynomial terms to your model and tests the joint hypothesis that their coefficients are all zero. Thus, the null hypothesis of the test is H0: “No higher-order polynomial terms are necessary”; if we reject the null hypothesis we need to consider including such terms.\nThe R function that performs a RESET test is resettest, which requires the following argumets: formula, the formula of the model to be tested or the name of an already calculated lm object; power, a set of integers indicating the powers of the polynomial terms to be included; type, which could be one of “fitted”, “regressor”, or “princomp”, indicating whether the aditional terms should be powers of the regressors, fitted values, or the first principal component of the regressor matrix; and, finally, data, which specifies the dataset to be used if a formula has been provided and not a model object. The following code applies the test to the complete faminc model, first using only quadratic terms of the fitted values, then using both quadratic and cubic terms.\nmod3 &lt;- lm(faminc~he+we+kl6, data=edu_inc)\nresettest(mod3, power=2, type=“fitted”)",

In our case both p-values are slightly lower than 0.05, indicating that the model marginally fails the specification test and some higher order terms may be necessary.\nLab 2 - Collinearity\nThere is collinearity among regressors when two or more regressors move closely with each other or display little variability. A consequence of collinearity is large variance in the estimated parameters, which increases the chances of not finding them significantly different from zero. The estimates are, however, unbiased since\n(imperfect) collinearity does not technically violate the Gauss-Markov assumptions. Collinearity tends to show insignificant coefficients even when measures of goodnessof-fit such as R2 or overall significance (the F-statistic) may be quite large.\nLet us consider the example of the dataset cars, where mpg is miles per gallon, cyl is number of cylinders, eng is engine displacement in cubic inches, and wgt is the weight of the vehicle in pounds.\nThis naive model suggests a strong effect of the number of cylinders on fuel economy, but if we introduce more terms in the equation this result changes substantially.\nTable 6.11: Multivariate ’mpg’ model\nTable 6.12: Variance inflation factors for the ’mpg’ regression model\nmod2 &lt;- lm(mpg~cyl+eng+wgt, data=cars)\nkable(tidy(mod2), caption=“Multivariate ‘mpg’ model”)\nIn the model summarized in Table 6.11 the number of cylinders becomes insignificant alltogether, a sharp change with respect to the previous specification. This high sensitivity of the estimates when other variables are introduced is also a sign of collinearity. Indeed, it is reasonable to believe that the characteristics of the vehicles vary together: heavier vehicles have more cylinders and bigger engines.\nA test that may be useful in detecting collinearity is to calculate the variance inflation factor, V IF, for each regressor. The rule of thumb is that a regressor produces collinearity if its V IF is greater than 10. Equation 6.13 shows the formula for the variance inflation factor, where Rk2 is the R2 from regressing the variable xk on all the remaining regressors.\n1\nV IFk = 1 − Rk2 (6.13)\nThe results in Table 6.12 show that the regressors cyl and eng fail the collinearity test, having V IFs greater than 10.\nTable 6.13: Forecasting in the quadratic ’andy’ model\n6.7 Prediction and Forecasting\nWe have previously discussed the semantic difference between prediction and forecasting, with prediction meaning the estimation of an expected value of the response and forecasting meaning an estimate of a particular value of the response. We mentioned that, for the same vector of regressors, prediction has a narrower confidence interval than forecasting because forecasting includes, besides the uncertainty of the expected value of the response, the variablility of a particular observation about its mean. I essentially repeat the same procedure here for the quadratic andy model, which regresses sales on price, advert, and advert2. The key R function to calculate both predictions and forecasts is the function predict, with the following arguments: model, which is the name of a model object; newdata, which contains the new data points where prediction is desired; if newdata is missing, predictions are calculated for all observations in the dataset; interval, which can be “none”, “confidence”, or\n“prediction”, and tells R whether we want only a point estimate of the response, a prediction with its confidence interval, or a forecast with its confidence interval; level, which is the confidence level we want; if missing, level is 95%; other arguments (see ?predict() for more details).\nTable 6.13 displays the point estimate and forecast interval estimate for the data point price = $6 and advert = 1.9, which, remember, stands for advertising expenditure of $1900.\nUsing Indicator Variables\nThis chapter introduces the package lmtest (Hothorn et al. 2015).\n7.1 Factor Variables\nIndicator variables show the presence of a certain non-quantifiable attribute, such as whether an individual is male or female, or whether a house has a swimming pool. In R, an indicator variable is called factor, category, or ennumerated type and there is no distinction between binary (such as yes-no, or male-female) or multiple-category factors.\nFactors can be either numerical or character variables, ordered or not. R automatically creates dummy variables for each category within a factor variable and excludes a\n99\nTable 7.1: Summary for ’utown’ dataset\n(baseline) category from a model. The choice of the baseline category, as well as which categories should be included can be changed using the function contrasts().\nThe following code fragment loads the utown data, declares the indicator variables utown, pool, and fplace as factors, and displays a summary statistics table (Table\n7.1). Please notice that the factor variables are represented in the summary table as count data, i.e., how many observations are in each category.\nlibrary(stargazer);\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndata(“utown”, package=“PoEdata”)\nutown\\(utown &lt;- as.factor(utown\\)utown)\nutown\\(pool &lt;- as.factor(utown\\)pool)\nutown\\(fplace &lt;- as.factor(utown\\)fplace)\nkable(summary.data.frame(utown), caption=“Summary for ‘utown’ dataset”)\nThis example uses the utown dataset, where prices are in thousands, sqft is the living area is hundreds of square feet, and utown marks houses located near university.\n7.2 Examples\nmod4 &lt;- lm(price~utown*sqft+age+pool+fplace, data=utown)\nkable(tidy(mod4), caption=“The ‘house prices’ model”)\nbsqft &lt;- 1000*coef(mod4)[[“sqft”]]\nbsqft1 &lt;- 1000*(coef(mod4)[[“sqft”]]+coef(mod4)[[“utown1:sqft”]])\nNotice how the model in the above code sequence has been specified: the term utown*sqft created three terms: utown, sqft, and the interaction term utown:sqft.\nTable 7.2 shows the estimated coefficients and their statistics; please notice how the factor variables have been market at the end of their names with 1 to show which\nTable 7.2: The ’house prices’ model\ncategory they represent. For instance, utown1 is the equivalent of a dummy variable equal to 1 when utown is equal to 1. When a factor has n categories the regression output will show n − 1 dummies marked to identify each category.\nAccording to the results in Table 7.2, an extra hundred square feet increases the price by bsqft=$7612.18 if the house is not near university and by bsqft1 = $8911.58 if the house is near university. This example shows how interaction terms allow distinguishing the marginal effect of a continuous variable (sqft) for one category (utown=1) from the marginal effect of the same continuous variable within another category (utown=0).\nIn general, the marginal effect of a regressor on the response is, as we have seen before, the partial derivative of the response with respect to that regressor. For example, the marginal effect of sqft in the house prices model is as shown in Equation 7.1.\n[sqft] + utown × b[utown : sqft] (7.1)\nLet us look at another example, the wage equation using the dataset cps4_small.\ndata(“cps4_small”, package=“PoEdata”)\nnames(cps4_small)",

    "text": "7.70 [8] “midwest” “south” “west” “black” “asian”\nThis dataset already includes dummy variables for gender, race, and region, so that we do not need R’s capability of building these dummies for us. Although usually it is useful to declare the categorical variables as factors, I will not do so this time. Let us consider the model in Equation 7.2.\nwage = β1 + β2educ + δ1black + δ2female + γ(black × female) (7.2)\nTable 7.3: A wage-discrimination model\nWhat are the expected wages for different categories, according to Equation 7.2 and Table 7.3?\nwhite male: β1 + β2educ (the baseline category)\nblack male: β1 + β2educ + δ1\nwhite female: β1 + β2educ + δ2\nblack female: β1 + β2educ + δ1 + δ2 + γ\nThese formulas help evaluating the differences in wage expectations between different categories. For instance, given the same education, the difference between black female and white male is δ1 + δ2 + γ = −5.11, which means that the average black female is paid less by $5.11 than the average white man.\nTo test the hypothesis that neither race nor gender affects wage is to test the joint hypothesis H0 : δ1 = 0, δ2 = 0, γ = 0 against the alterntive that at least one of these coefficients is different from zero. We have learned already how to perform an F-test the hard way and how to retrieve the quantities needed for the F-statistic (SSER, SSEU, J, and N − K). Let us this time use R’s linearHypothesis function.\nThe results in Table 7.4 indicates that the null hypothesis of no discrimination can be rejected.\nTable 7.4: Testing a joint hypothesis for the ’wage’ equation\nLab 3 - Comparing Two Regressions: the Chow Test\nBy interacting a binary indicator variable with all the terms in a regression and testing that the new terms are insignificant we can determine if a certain category is significantly different than the other categories. Starting with the wage regression in Equation 7.2, let us include the indicator variable “south”.\nThe table titled “Model comparison, ‘wage’ equation” presents the results of three equations: equation (1) is the full wage model with all terms interacted with variable south; equation (2) is the basic ‘wage’ model shown in Equation 7.2 with the sample restricted to non-south regions, and, finally, equation (3) is the same as (2) but with the sample restricted only to the south region. (This table is constructed with the function stargazer from the package by the same name (Hlavac 2015).)\nHowever, in R it is not necessary to split the data manually as I did in the above code sequence; instead, we just write two equations like mod5 and mod6 and ask R to do a Chow test to see if the two equations are statistically identical. The Chow test is performed in R by the function anova, with the results presented in Table 7.6, where the F statistic is equal to 0.320278 and the corresponding p-value of 0.900945.\nkable(anova(mod5, mod6), caption=“Chow test for the ‘wage’ equation”)\nTable 7.6 indicates that the null hypothesis that the equations are equivalent cannot be rejected. In other words, our test provides no evidence that wages in the south Table 7.5: region are statistically different from the rest of the regions.\nModel comparison, ’wage’ equation\nwage\nTable 7.6: Chow test for the ’wage’ equation\nIndicator Variables in Log-Linear Models\nAn indicator regressor is essentially no different from a continuous one and its interpretation is very similar to the one we have studied in the context of log-linear models. In a model like log(y) = β1+β2x+δD, where D is an indicator variable, the percentage difference between the two categories represented by D can be calculated in two ways, both using the coefficient δ:\napproximate: %∆y ∼= 100δ\nexact: %∆y = 100(eδ − 1)\nLet us calculate these two effets in a log-linear wage equation based on the dataset cps4_small.\ndata(“cps4_small”, package=“PoEdata”) mod1 &lt;- lm(log(wage)~educ+female, data=cps4_small) approx &lt;- 100coef(mod1)[[“female”]] exact &lt;- 100(exp(coef(mod1)[[“female”]])-1)\nThe results indicate a percentage difference in expected wage between females and males as follows: %∆wage = −24.32% (approximate), or %∆wage = −21.59%\n(exact).\n7.5 The Linear Probability Model\nLinear probability models are regression models in which the response, rather than a regressor is a binary indicator variable. However, since the regressors can be either continuous or factor variables, the fitted values will be continuous. Equation 7.3, where y ∈ {0,1} shows a general linear probability model.\ny = β1 + β2x2 + … + βkxk + e (7.3)\nHow can a continous fitted variable be interpreted when the actual response is binary? As it turns out, the fitted value represents the probability that the response takes the value 1, yˆ = Pr(y = 1). There are two major problems with this model. First, the model is heteroskedastic, with the variance being larger in the middle range of the fitted values; second, the fitted variable being continuous, it can take values, unlike a probability function, outside the interval [0,1].\nTable 7.7: Linear probability model, the ’coke’ example\nThe next example, based on the dataset coke estimates the probability that a customer chooses coke when coke or pepsi are displayed. Besides the two indicator variables disp_coke and disp_pepsi, the model includes the price ratio between coke and pepsi.\nFigure 7.1 plots the probalility of choosing coke with respect to the price ratio for the four possible combinations of the indicator variables disp_coke and disp_pepsi. In addition, the graph shows the observation points, all located at a height of either 0 or 1. In the legend, the first digit is 0 if coke is not displayed and 1 otherwise; the second digit does the same for pepsi. Thus, the highest probability of choosing coke for any given pratio happens when coke is displayed and pepsi is not (the line marked 10).\nFigure 7.1: Linear probability: the ’coke’ example\n7.6 Treatment Effects\nTreatment effects models aim at measuring the differences between a treatment group and a control group. The difference estimator is the simplest such a model and consists in constructing an indicator variable to distinguish between the two groups. Consider, for example, Equation 7.4, where di = 1 if observation i belongs to the treatment group and di = 0 otherwise.\nyi = β1 + β2di + ei (7.4)\nThus, the expected value of the response is β1 for the control group and β1 + β2 for the treatment group. Put otherwise, the coefficient on the dummy variable represents the difference between the treatment and the control group. Moreover, it turns out that b2, the estimator of β2 is equal to the difference between the sample averages of the two groups:\nb2 = ¯y1 − y¯0 (7.5)\nThe dataset star contains information on students from kindergarten to the third grade and was built to identify the determinants of student performance. Let us use this dataset for an example of a difference estimator, as well as an example of selecting just part of the variables and observations in a dataset.\nThe next piece of code presents a few new elements, that are used to select only a set of all the variables in the dataset, then to split the dataset in two parts: one for small classes, and one for regular classes. Lets look at these elements in the order in which they appear in the code. The function attach(datasetname) allows subsequent use of variable names without specifying from which database they come. While in general doing this is not advisable, I used it to simplify the next lines of code, which lists the variables I want to extract and assigns them to variable vars. As soon as I am done with splitting my dataset, I detach() the dataset to avoid subsequent confusion.\nThe line starregular is the one that actually retrieves the wanted variables and observations from the dataset. In essence, it picks from the dataset star the lines for whichsmall==0 (see, no need for star$small as long as star is still attached).\nThe same about the variable starsmall. Another novelty in the following code fragment is the use of the R function stargazer() to vizualize a summary table instead of the usual function summary; stargazer shows a more familiar version of the summary statistics table.\nstargazer(starsmall, type=.stargazertype, header=FALSE, title=“Dataset ‘star’ for small classes”)\nThe two tables titled “Dataset’star’…” display summary statistics for a number of variables in dataset ‘star’. The difference in the means of totalscore is equal to\n13.740553, which should be equal to the coefficient of the dummy variable small in\nEquation 7.6. (Note: the results for this dataset seem to be slightly different from\nPoE4 because the datasets used are of different sizes.)\ntotalscore = β1 + β2small + e (7.6)\nTable 7.8: Dataset ’star’ for regular classes\nmod3 &lt;- lm(totalscore~small, data=star) b2 &lt;- coef(mod3)[[“small”]]\nThe difference estimated based on Equation 7.6 is b2 = 13.740553, which coincides with the difference in means we calculated above.\nIf the students were randomly assigned to small or regular classes and the number of observations is large there is no need for additional regressors (there is no omitted variable bias if other regressors are not correlated with the variable small). In some instances, however, including other regressors may improve the difference estimator. Here is a model that includes a ‘teacher experience’ variable and some school characteristics (the students were randomized within schools, but schools were not randomized).\nschool &lt;- as.factor(star$schid)#creates dummies for schools mod4 &lt;- lm(totalscore~small+tchexper, data=star) mod5 &lt;- lm(totalscore~small+tchexper+school, data=star)\nb2n &lt;- coef(mod4)[[“small”]] b2s &lt;- coef(mod5)[[“small”]] anova(mod4, mod5)\nBy the introduction of school fixed effects the difference estimate have increased from\n14.306725 to 15.320602. The anova() function, which tests the equivalence of the two regressions yields a very low p-value indicating that the difference between the two models is significant.\nI have mentioned already, in the context of collinearity that a way to check if there is a relationship between an independent variable and the others is to regress that variable on the others and check the overall significance of the regression. The same method allows checking if the assignments to the treated and control groups are random. If we regress small on the other regressors and the assignment was random we should find no significant relationship.\nmod6 &lt;- lm(small~boy+white_asian+tchexper+freelunch, data=star) kable(tidy(mod6),\ncaption=“Checking random assignment in the ‘star’ dataset”)\nfstat &lt;- glance(mod6)\\(statistic pf &lt;- glance(mod6)\\)p.value\nThe F-statistic of the model in Table 7.10 is F = 2.322664 and its corresponding p-value 0.054362, which shows that the model is overall insignificant at the 5% level\n7.7. THE DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES ESTIMATOR\nTable 7.10: Checking random assignment in the ’star’ dataset\nor lower. The coefficients of the independent variables are insignificant or extremely small (the coefficient on tchexper is statistically significant, but its marginal effect is a change in the probability that small = 1 of about 0.3 percent). Again, these results provide fair evidence that the students’ assignment to small or regular classes was random.\nLab 4 -The Difference-in-Differences Estimator\nIn many economic problems, which do not benefit from the luxury of random samples, the selection into one of the two groups is by choice, thus introducing a selection bias. The difference estimator is biased to the extent to which selection bias is present, therefore it is inadequate when selection bias may be present. The more complex difference-in-differences estimator is more appropriate in such cases. While the simple difference estimator assumes that before the treatment all units are identical or, at least, that the assignment to the treatment and control group is random, the difference-in-differences estimator takes into account any initial heterogeneity between the two groups.\nThe two ‘differences’ in the diference-in-differences estimator are: (i) the difference in the means of the treatment and control groups in the response variable after the treatment, and (ii) the difference in the means of the treatment and control groups in the response variable before the treatment. The ‘difference’ is between after and before.\nLet us denote four averages of the response, as follows:\ny¯T,A Treatment, After\ny¯C,A Control, After\ny¯T,B Treatment, Before\ny¯C,B Control, Before\nThe difference-in-differences estimator δˆ is defined as in Equation 7.7.\nδˆ = (¯yT,A − y¯C,A) − (¯yT,B − y¯C,B) (7.7)\nInstead of manually calculating the four means and their difference-in-differences, it is possible to estimate the difference-in-differences estimator and its statistical properties by running a regression that includes indicator variables for treatment and after and their interaction term. The advantage of a regression over simply using Equation 7.7 is that the regression allows taking into account other factors that might influence the treatment effect. The simplest difference-in-differences regression model is presented in Equation 7.8, where yit is the response for unit i in period t. In the typical difference-in-differences model there are only two periods, before and after.\nyit = β1 + β2T + β3A + δT × A + eit (7.8)\nWith a litle algebra it can be seen that the coefficinet δ on the interaction term in\nEquation 7.8 is exactly the difference-in-differences estimator defined in Equation\n7.7. The following example calculates this estimator for the dataset njmin3, where the response is fte, the full-time equivalent employment, d is the after dummy, with d = 1 for the after period and d = 0 for the before period, and nj is the dummy that marks the treatment group (nji = 1 if unit i is in New Jersey where the minimum wage law has been changed, and nji = 0 if unit i in Pennsylvania, where the minimum wage law has not changed). In other words, units (fast-food restaurants) located in New Jersey form the treatment group, and units located in Pennsylvania form the control group.",

R PRACTICUM\n7.9 R Practicum\n7.9.1 Extracting Various Information\nHere is a reminder on how to extract various results after fitting a linear model. The function names(lm.object) returns a list of the names of different items contained in the object. Suppose we run an lm() model and name it mod5. Then, mod5$name returns the item identified by the name. Like about everything in R, there are many ways to extract values from an lm() object. I will present three objects that contain about everything we will need. These are the lm() object itself, summary(lm()), and the function glance(lm()) in package broom. The next code shows the name lists for all three objects and a few examples of extracting various statistics.\nlibrary(broom)\nmod5 &lt;- mod5 &lt;- lm(wage~educ+black*female, data=cps4_small)\nsmod5 &lt;- summary(mod5)\ngmod5 &lt;- glance(mod5) #from package ‘broom’ names(mod5)",
