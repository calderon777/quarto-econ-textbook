Econometrics introduces quantitative methods for both qualitative and quantitative data analysis. The focus includes a variety of estimation methods for economic data with diverse structures and uses applied applications of these econometric methods to estimate empirical models.  These techniques provide a foundation for the final-year dissertation project.

 

Data Analytics provides an applied framework for economists to understand economic decision-making and the formation of expectations and forecasting. Analytics follows a topic-based approach to forecasting techniques and automatisation to areas of study such as Economics, Environmental Economics, Capital Markets, and Financial Economics. The content also covers an introduction to the Trading room, this will allow the techniques to be contextualised to applied problems. 

This handbook has been produced to provide students with specific information and guidance about their labs. The contents of this handbook are indicative, this means they can be updated or modified upon the review of the module leader (Cam).

An electronic version of this handbook (which is continuously updated) is available on the VLE system, which you should consult regularly as the main reference point throughout your studies.

The handbook is organised in 50 minutes chunks, sometimes active lectures, othertimes practical labs.
